## Critical Accounting Considerations

### 1. Revenue Recognition (ASC 606)

Construction contracts are typically accounted for **over time** using an input or output method:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           REVENUE RECOGNITION - OVER TIME                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  Step 1: Identify contract(s) with customer                 │
│  Step 2: Identify performance obligations                    │
│  Step 3: Determine transaction price                         │
│  Step 4: Allocate price to performance obligations           │
│  Step 5: Recognize revenue as obligations satisfied          │
│                                                              │
│  For Construction: Typically ONE performance obligation      │
│  (integrated output) recognized OVER TIME                    │
│                                                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Measuring Progress

| Method | Basis | Best Used When |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Cost-to-cost** | Costs incurred ÷ Total estimated costs | Most common; costs correlate with progress |
| **Survey of work** | Physical completion % | Observable progress stages |
| **Units delivered** | Output measures | Standard unit production |
| **Milestones** | Discrete stages of completion | Clear milestone points |

#### The Critical Calculation

```
PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION CALCULATION:

Costs Incurred to Date                    $   750,000
Estimated Costs to Complete               +   250,000
                                          -----------
Total Estimated Costs                     $ 1,000,000

Percent Complete = $750,000 ÷ $1,000,000 = 75%

Contract Price                            $ 1,200,000
× Percent Complete                              × 75%
                                          -----------
Revenue to Recognize (cumulative)         $   900,000
Less: Revenue Previously Recognized           (600,000)
                                          -----------
Current Period Revenue                    $   300,000
```

### 2. Contract Assets and Liabilities

| Account | Definition | Presentation |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Contract asset** | Revenue recognized > Billings | Current asset |
| **Contract liability** | Billings > Revenue recognized | Current liability |
| **Retainage receivable** | Amounts withheld pending completion | Separate line or disclosure |
| **Retainage payable** | Amounts withheld from subs | Current or long-term liability |

### 3. Costs to Obtain/Fulfill Contracts

| Cost Type | Treatment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Pre-contract costs** | Expense as incurred (unless specific exception) |
| **Bid costs** | Expense as incurred |
| **Mobilization costs** | May be capitalizable; amortize over contract |
| **Direct costs** | Include in job costs |
| **Indirect costs** | Allocate systematically |

### 4. Change Orders and Claims

| Item | Recognition |
|------|------------|
| **Approved change orders** | Add to contract price |
| **Unapproved change orders** | Variable consideration - constrain estimate |
| **Claims** | Include only to extent highly probable |
| **Incentive payments** | Variable consideration - estimate and constrain |
| **Penalties** | Reduce transaction price |

## Key Financial Statement Areas

### Balance Sheet Considerations

```
CONSTRUCTION BALANCE SHEET - KEY ACCOUNTS:

ASSETS:
  Cash and equivalents
  Contract receivables
    Billed receivables
    Unbilled receivables (retainage)
  Contracts in progress (cost + profit to date)
  Less: Billings to date
    = Contract assets (underbillings)
  Inventory (materials, work in process)
  Property and equipment (heavy equipment)
  Deposits on equipment

LIABILITIES:
  Accounts payable - trade
  Retainage payable
  Contracts in progress (cost + profit to date)
  Less: Billings to date
    = Contract liabilities (overbillings)
  Notes payable - equipment
  Line of credit
  Surety bond obligations
  Accrued payroll and taxes
```

### Working Capital Analysis

```
CONSTRUCTION WORKING CAPITAL:

Traditional Current Assets
Less: Traditional Current Liabilities
= Working Capital

BUT ALSO CONSIDER:
+ Underbillings (contract assets)
- Overbillings (contract liabilities)
= Adjusted Working Capital

Bonding companies focus on adjusted working capital
```

```

#### Required Disclosures

| Disclosure | Content |
|------------|---------|
| **Revenue recognition** | Method for measuring progress |
| **Contract balances** | Assets, liabilities, retainage |
| **Significant judgments** | Estimates, variable consideration |
| **Backlog** | Remaining performance obligations |
| **Contract costs** | Capitalized costs, amortization |
| **Related parties** | Common in construction (affiliated companies) |

### Common Departures from GAAP (Construction)

| Departure | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **Completed contract method** | Not GAAP under ASC 606 for most contracts |
| **Improper cost-to-complete** | Not updating estimates |
| **Ignoring variable consideration** | Not including change orders/claims properly |
| **Missing contract balance disclosures** | Required under ASC 606 |
| **No backlog disclosure** | Required for remaining performance obligations |
| **Retainage classification** | Should segregate or disclose |

---

## Special Considerations

### Job Cost Systems

Understanding the client's job cost system is critical:

| Element | Considerations |
|---------|---------------|
| **Direct labor** | Tracked to jobs, burden rates |
| **Direct materials** | Purchase orders, inventory tracking |
| **Subcontractor costs** | Contracts, change orders, retainage |
| **Equipment costs** | Owned equipment allocation, rentals |
| **Overhead allocation** | Method, consistency, reasonableness |

### Bonding and Surety

| Aspect | Importance |
|--------|-----------|
| **Bonding capacity** | Limits work that can be taken |
| **Working capital** | Key metric for sureties |
| **WIP schedule accuracy** | Sureties rely heavily on this |
| **Indemnity agreements** | Personal guarantees, collateral |
| **Letter of credit** | Alternative to bonds |

### Joint Ventures

Common in large construction projects:

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|---------------|
| **Equity method** | For significant joint ventures |
| **Consolidation** | If control exists |
| **Pro-rata method** | Sometimes used in practice |
| **Related party** | Transactions with JV partners |

---

## Common Peer Review Deficiencies - Construction

| Deficiency | Prevention |
|------------|------------|
| No WIP schedule | Obtain and analyze for all engagements |
| Cost-to-complete not evaluated | Inquire about estimate methodology |
| Change orders not addressed | Determine status and recognition |
| Missing contract asset/liability disclosure | Present properly on face or notes |
| Fade/gain analysis not performed | Compare original to revised estimates |
| Backlog disclosure missing | Disclose remaining performance obligations |
| Retainage not properly presented | Classify or disclose appropriately |
