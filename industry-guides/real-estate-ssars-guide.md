### 2. Revenue Recognition

#### Rental Revenue

| Component | Recognition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Base rent** | Straight-line over lease term |
| **Percentage rent** | When breakpoint achieved |
| **CAM charges** | As services provided |
| **Lease termination fees** | When termination occurs |
| **Tenant improvements** | Lease incentive - amortize |

#### ASC 842 - Lessor Accounting

| Lease Type | Classification Criteria |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Operating lease** | Default - most common for landlords |
| **Sales-type lease** | Transfer of ownership, purchase option likely |
| **Direct financing lease** | Meets criteria but no selling profit |

#### Property Sales Revenue (ASC 606)

Sale revenue recognized when:
1. Contract exists
2. Control transfers to buyer
3. Typically at closing (in full)

**Key considerations:**
- Seller financing arrangements
- Repurchase options
- Continuing involvement

### 3. Lease Accounting (Tenant/Lessee - ASC 842)

For real estate entities as tenants:

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Right-of-use asset** | Present value of lease payments |
| **Lease liability** | Same, separate current/long-term |
| **Lease expense** | Straight-line for operating leases |
| **Initial direct costs** | Add to ROU asset |
| **Lease incentives** | Reduce ROU asset |

### 4. Development and Construction

| Phase | Accounting Treatment |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Pre-acquisition** | Expense until probable acquisition |
| **Land acquisition** | Capitalize all direct costs |
| **Development** | Capitalize interest, taxes, direct costs |
| **Construction** | Capitalize all construction costs |
| **Completion** | Begin depreciation or hold as inventory |

#### Interest Capitalization

```
INTEREST CAPITALIZATION:

Qualifying assets:
• Assets constructed for own use
• Assets developed for sale

Capitalize interest during:
• Active development/construction period
• Until asset is ready for intended use

Stop capitalizing when:
• Asset is substantially complete
• Development activities are suspended
```

## Review Engagement Considerations

### Analytical Procedures for Real Estate

#### Property-Level Analysis

| Procedure | What to Look For |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Occupancy rates | Trends, comparison to market |
| Rent per square foot | Market comparison |
| Operating expense ratio | Efficiency trends |
| CAM recovery rate | Recovery of pass-through costs |
| Tenant turnover | Lease stability |

#### Key Ratios

| Ratio | Formula | What It Means |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Occupancy rate** | Occupied SF ÷ Total SF | Property utilization |
| **NOI margin** | NOI ÷ Revenue | Operating efficiency |
| **Debt service coverage** | NOI ÷ Debt service | Ability to cover debt |
| **Loan-to-value** | Debt ÷ Property value | Leverage level |
| **Cap rate** | NOI ÷ Property value | Investment return measure |
| **Expense ratio** | Operating expenses ÷ Revenue | Cost management |
| **Breakeven occupancy** | Break-even ÷ Potential rent | Minimum occupancy needed |

#### Development Project Analysis

| Procedure | What to Look For |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Cost-to-complete | Budget vs. actual |
| Capitalized interest | Proper calculation |
| Pre-sales/pre-leasing | Demand indicators |
| Estimated margins | Developer's projections |
| Financing terms | Interest rates, maturities |

### Inquiry Areas for Real Estate

```
Required Real Estate-Specific Inquiries:

[ ] Occupancy trends and significant tenant changes
[ ] Lease renewals, expirations, defaults
[ ] Rent concessions or abatements granted
[ ] CAM reconciliations and disputes
[ ] Property condition, capital needs
[ ] Environmental issues (Phase I, contamination)
[ ] Property tax assessments and appeals
[ ] Insurance coverage adequacy
[ ] Debt covenant compliance
[ ] Refinancing plans or needs
[ ] Related party transactions (common in RE)
[ ] Property sales completed or planned
[ ] Development project status
[ ] Joint venture activities
[ ] Property impairment indicators

```

## Compilation Considerations

### Financial Statement Presentation

#### Required Disclosures

| Disclosure | Content |
|------------|---------|
| **Property description** | Type, location, size |
| **Depreciation** | Methods, lives |
| **Lease information** | Terms, future minimums |
| **Related parties** | Very common in real estate |
| **Debt** | Terms, maturities, covenants |
| **Commitments** | Development, capital calls |
| **Impairment** | Indicators and assessment |

### Common Departures from GAAP (Real Estate)

| Departure | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **Cash basis rent revenue** | Should be straight-line |
| **No depreciation** | Required for investment property |
| **Improper interest capitalization** | During development |
| **Missing lease disclosures** | Both lessor and lessee |
| **Related party not disclosed** | Very common omission |
| **Impairment not considered** | Required when indicators exist |
| **Improper development costs** | Should capitalize during active development |

---

## Special Considerations

### Related Party Transactions

Real estate commonly involves related party transactions:

| Common Situations | Disclosure Requirement |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Property management by owner/affiliate | Disclose terms and amounts |
| Leases to related entities | Disclose terms |
| Loans from/to related parties | Disclose terms and balances |
| Development services by affiliate | Disclose relationship and amounts |
| Property transfers between entities | Fair value considerations |

### Property Valuation/Impairment

#### Impairment Indicators

```
IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS - REAL ESTATE:

[ ] Significant decline in market value
[ ] Adverse changes in legal factors (zoning, taxes)
[ ] Significant cost overruns during development
[ ] Major tenant bankruptcy or default
[ ] Significant decline in occupancy
[ ] Significant decline in market rents
[ ] Inability to lease vacant space
[ ] Cash flow losses, negative NOI
[ ] Debt exceeds fair value
[ ] Physical damage or obsolescence
```

#### Impairment Testing (ASC 360)

```
TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST:

Step 1: Recoverability Test
  Expected undiscounted cash flows > Carrying amount?
  If YES → No impairment
  If NO → Proceed to Step 2

Step 2: Measurement
  Impairment loss = Carrying amount - Fair value
  Write down to fair value
```

### Like-Kind Exchanges (1031)

While primarily a tax concept, understand:
- Book vs. tax basis differences
- Deferred gain tracking
- Property identification rules
- Qualified intermediary requirements

---

## Common Peer Review Deficiencies - Real Estate

| Deficiency | Prevention |
|------------|------------|
| Rental revenue not straight-lined | Apply ASC 842 lessor guidance |
| Related party transactions not disclosed | Inquire specifically about all relationships |
| Missing lease disclosures | Include lessor and lessee disclosures |
| Impairment indicators ignored | Evaluate indicators at each period |
| Interest capitalization errors | Calculate properly during development |
| Debt disclosures incomplete | Include terms, maturities, covenants |
| Property classification errors | Determine intent and use |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Property classification is critical** - Inventory vs. fixed asset vs. held for sale
2. **Straight-line rent is required** - Not cash basis for operating leases
3. **Related party transactions are everywhere** - Inquire and disclose
4. **Impairment must be considered** - Evaluate indicators each period
5. **ASC 842 affects both lessor and lessee** - New lease accounting applies
6. **Interest capitalization during development** - Know when to start/stop
7. **Disclosure requirements are extensive** - Properties, leases, debt, related parties
