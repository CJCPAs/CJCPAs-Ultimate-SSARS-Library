# Nonprofit Organizations SSARS Guide

## Overview

Nonprofit organizations follow specialized accounting standards (ASC 958) that differ significantly from for-profit entities. SSARS engagements for nonprofits require understanding of net asset classifications, contribution accounting, functional expense allocation, and unique disclosure requirements.

## Types of Nonprofit Organizations

| Organization Type | Key Characteristics |
|------------------|-------------------|
| **Charitable organizations (501(c)(3))** | Tax-deductible contributions, public support test |
| **Private foundations** | Minimum distribution, excise taxes |
| **Religious organizations** | May have different reporting requirements |
| **Educational institutions** | Tuition, endowments, grants |
| **Healthcare nonprofits** | Charity care, third-party payers |
| **Social welfare (501(c)(4))** | Advocacy, lobbying activities |
| **Trade associations (501(c)(6))** | Membership dues, unrelated business income |
| **Social clubs (501(c)(7))** | Member activities, investment income rules |
| **HOAs** | Assessments, reserve funds |
| **Governmental entities** | GASB standards may apply instead |

## Critical Accounting Considerations (ASC 958)

### 1. Net Asset Classification

Nonprofits classify net assets into two categories (post-ASU 2016-14):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              NET ASSET CLASSIFICATIONS                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  WITHOUT DONOR RESTRICTIONS                                  │
│  • Previously called "Unrestricted"                         │
│  • Available for general operations                          │
│  • Board designations are internal (not a restriction)       │
│                                                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  WITH DONOR RESTRICTIONS                                     │
│  • Combines former "Temporarily" and "Permanently" restricted│
│  • Purpose restrictions: Use for specific purpose            │
│  • Time restrictions: Use in future periods                  │
│  • Perpetual restrictions: Principal cannot be spent         │
│                                                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Common Errors in Net Asset Classification

| Error | Correct Treatment |
|-------|------------------|
| Treating board designations as restrictions | Board designations are without restriction |
| Not releasing restrictions when purpose met | Must reclassify when restriction satisfied |
| Ignoring time restrictions | Recognize when time restriction expires |
| Commingling restricted and unrestricted | Maintain separate tracking |

### 2. Contribution Revenue

#### Recognition Criteria

Contributions are recognized when:
1. **Unconditional promise** to give is received (or cash received)
2. **Conditional contributions** recognized when conditions are substantially met

#### Unconditional vs. Conditional

| Feature | Unconditional | Conditional |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Recognition** | When promise received | When condition met |
| **Balance sheet** | Contribution receivable | Refundable advance |
| **Barrier** | None | Must overcome barrier |
| **Right of return** | No | Yes, if condition not met |

#### Barriers (Conditions)

Common barriers that make a contribution conditional:
- Measurable performance requirements
- Specific outcomes to be achieved
- Matching requirements
- Limits on discretion (beyond administrative)

### 3. Functional Expense Classification

Nonprofits must present expenses by function AND nature:

```
FUNCTIONAL CATEGORIES:
├── Program Services (mission-related)
│   ├── Program A
│   ├── Program B
│   └── Program C
├── Supporting Services
│   ├── Management and General
│   ├── Fundraising
│   └── Membership Development (if applicable)
```

#### Allocation Methods

| Expense Type | Common Allocation Methods |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Salaries** | Time studies, direct assignment |
| **Occupancy** | Square footage, headcount |
| **Depreciation** | Asset usage, square footage |
| **Professional fees** | Direct assignment, purpose |
| **Supplies** | Direct assignment, program usage |
| **Joint costs** | Physical units, relative costs, audience |

### 4. Required Financial Statements

Under ASU 2016-14:

| Statement | Required Elements |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Statement of Financial Position** | Net assets by classification |
| **Statement of Activities** | Changes in net assets by classification |
| **Statement of Functional Expenses** | Matrix of expenses by function and nature |
| **Statement of Cash Flows** | Direct or indirect method |

---

## Review Engagement Considerations

### Analytical Procedures for Nonprofits

#### Revenue Analytics

| Procedure | What to Look For |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Contribution trends | Donor concentration, major gifts |
| Program revenue trends | Fee-for-service changes |
| Grant revenue analysis | New/expired grants, compliance |
| Investment return | Market performance, spending policy |
| Fundraising effectiveness | Cost to raise a dollar |

#### Key Ratios

| Ratio | Formula | What It Means |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Program expense ratio** | Program expenses ÷ Total expenses | % spent on mission |
| **Fundraising efficiency** | Fundraising expense ÷ Contributions | Cost to raise $1 |
| **Administrative ratio** | M&G expenses ÷ Total expenses | Overhead percentage |
| **Operating reliance** | Operating revenue ÷ Total revenue | Sustainability |
| **Months of cash** | Cash ÷ Monthly expenses | Liquidity |
| **Months of liquid reserves** | Net assets w/o restrictions ÷ Monthly expenses | Unrestricted cushion |

#### Expense Analytics

| Procedure | What to Look For |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Salary trends | Staffing changes, compensation |
| Program cost per unit | Service delivery efficiency |
| Occupancy as % of budget | Facility costs reasonableness |
| Functional allocation trends | Shifting to/from programs |

### Inquiry Areas for Nonprofits

## Compilation Considerations

### Financial Statement Presentation

#### Required Disclosures for Nonprofits

| Disclosure | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Net asset composition** | Nature of restrictions |
| **Liquidity and availability** | Qualitative and quantitative |
| **Functional expense allocation** | Methods used |
| **Endowment funds** | Composition, spending policy, UPMIFA |
| **Board designations** | Amounts designated by board |
| **Contributed services** | If recognized, nature and amount |
| **In-kind contributions** | Fair value methodology |
| **Related party** | Transactions with affiliates |
| **Concentrations** | Revenue, grants, donors |

#### Liquidity Disclosure (Required)

Example liquidity disclosure format:

```
Financial assets available for general use within one year:

Cash and cash equivalents                          $   250,000
Accounts receivable                                     75,000
Contributions receivable, current                      150,000
Investments                                            500,000
                                                   -----------
Total financial assets                                 975,000

Less: Amounts not available for general use:
  Subject to donor restrictions                       (200,000)
  Board designations                                  (100,000)
                                                   -----------
Financial assets available to meet cash needs
  for general expenditures within one year         $   675,000
                                                   ===========
```

### Common Departures from GAAP (Nonprofits)

| Departure | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| **No net asset classification** | Must show two categories |
| **No functional expense statement** | Required matrix presentation |
| **Missing liquidity disclosure** | Required under ASU 2016-14 |
| **Improper contribution recognition** | Conditional vs. unconditional |
| **No underwater endowment disclosure** | Required if funds are underwater |
| **Missing in-kind contribution disclosure** | Must disclose nature and amount |
| **Incorrect expense allocation** | Must use rational methodology |

---

## Special Considerations

### Endowment Funds

#### UPMIFA Considerations

| Aspect | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **State law** | UPMIFA adoption varies by state |
| **Spending policy** | Prudent spending guidelines |
| **Underwater funds** | Special disclosure required |
| **Donor intent** | May override state law |
| **Investment policy** | Diversification, risk tolerance |

#### Underwater Endowments

When fair value falls below original gift amount:
- Continue to classify as with donor restriction
- Disclose: fair value, original gift amount, deficit
- Spending may continue if prudent and policy allows

### Contributed Services

Recognize contributed services when:
1. **Specialized skills** - Would need to purchase if not donated
2. **Controlled by organization** - Determines how used
3. **Can be measured** - Fair value determinable

| Recognize | Do Not Recognize |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Professional services (legal, accounting, medical) | General volunteer time |
| Skilled construction work | Board member service |
| Specialized teaching | Fundraising event help (typically) |

### In-Kind Contributions

| Type | Recognition |
|------|------------|
| **Materials and supplies** | Fair value when received |
| **Use of facilities** | Fair value of rent |
| **Services** | Only if criteria met |
| **Contributed art, collections** | Policy election available |

---

## Common Peer Review Deficiencies - Nonprofits

| Deficiency | Prevention |
|------------|------------|
| Missing or incorrect net asset classification | Understand restrictions; classify properly |
| No functional expense matrix | Present expenses by function AND nature |
| Missing liquidity disclosure | Include qualitative and quantitative information |
| Improper contribution recognition | Assess conditions vs. restrictions |
| No endowment disclosures | Include composition, policies, underwater funds |
| Expense allocation not documented | Document methodology and rationale |
| Related party transactions missed | Inquire about board member transactions |
| Missing Form 990 reconciliation | Understand differences between GAAP and 990 |

## Sample Representation Letter Items - Nonprofits

Include these nonprofit-specific representations:

```
Nonprofit-Specific Representations:

• Net assets have been properly classified as with donor restrictions
  and without donor restrictions based on the existence and nature of
  any donor-imposed restrictions.

• All donor-imposed restrictions have been identified and properly
  classified in the financial statements.

• Contributions have been properly distinguished between conditional
  and unconditional, and conditional contributions have been recognized
  only to the extent that conditions have been substantially met.

• The functional expense classification reflects a reasonable
  allocation of costs among programs and supporting activities.

• Endowment funds have been properly classified and the organization's
  spending policy complies with state law and donor restrictions.

• All significant in-kind contributions have been recorded at fair value,
  and the basis for valuation has been appropriately documented.

• There are no unrecorded liabilities for refundable advances, amounts
  due to grantors, or other obligations.

• The organization has maintained its tax-exempt status and is in
  compliance with the requirements of its exemption.

• All related party transactions have been disclosed, including
  transactions with board members, officers, and affiliated organizations.
```

## Form 990 Considerations

While not a GAAP requirement, understand that:

| Form 990 Area | SSARS Relevance |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Revenue recognition** | May differ from GAAP |
| **Functional expenses** | Must reconcile to GAAP |
| **Compensation** | Governance implications |
| **Related parties** | Required disclosure |
| **Governance policies** | May indicate control environment |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Two net asset classes** - Without and with donor restrictions
2. **Understand restrictions vs. conditions** - Different recognition timing
3. **Functional expenses are required** - Matrix presentation mandatory
4. **Liquidity disclosure is new** - Required under ASU 2016-14
5. **Endowments need attention** - UPMIFA, underwater funds, spending policies
6. **In-kind contributions are tricky** - Valuation and recognition criteria
7. **Related parties are common** - Board members often have transactions
