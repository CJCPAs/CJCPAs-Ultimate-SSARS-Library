#### Tips and Gratuities

| Item | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| **Voluntary tips** | Not restaurant revenue; pass-through to employees |
| **Mandatory service charges** | Restaurant revenue; employer determines distribution |
| **Tip pools** | Distribution among eligible employees |
| **Credit card tip fees** | Expense or reduction of tip (by policy/law) |
| **FICA tip credit** | Tax credit for employer FICA on tips |

#### Gift Cards

```
GIFT CARD ACCOUNTING:

Sale of Gift Card:
  Dr. Cash                    100
    Cr. Deferred Revenue          100

Redemption of Gift Card:
  Dr. Deferred Revenue        100
    Cr. Sales Revenue             100

Breakage (unredeemed amounts):
  Dr. Deferred Revenue         XX
    Cr. Breakage Revenue          XX
  (Recognize proportionally or when remote)
```

### 2. Inventory Management

| Inventory Type | Considerations |
|----------------|---------------|
| **Food inventory** | Perishability, waste, theft |
| **Beverage inventory** | High value, theft risk |
| **Paper goods/supplies** | Operating supplies vs. inventory |
| **Par levels** | Consistent inventory levels |

#### Inventory Valuation

| Method | Usage |
|--------|-------|
| **FIFO** | Most common, reflects flow |
| **Weighted average** | Acceptable alternative |
| **Specific identification** | Wine programs, specialty items |
| **Standard cost** | Some chain operations |

#### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target Range |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Food cost %** | Food COGS ÷ Food sales | 28-35% |
| **Beverage cost %** | Beverage COGS ÷ Beverage sales | 18-25% |
| **Prime cost %** | (COGS + Labor) ÷ Total sales | 55-65% |
| **Waste percentage** | Waste ÷ Purchases | < 2% |

### 3. Labor and Payroll

| Component | Special Considerations |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Hourly wages** | Minimum wage, tip credit |
| **Tipped employees** | Lower minimum with tip credit |
| **Overtime** | High in understaffed situations |
| **Benefits** | Often limited; ACA compliance |
| **Payroll taxes** | FICA, FUTA, SUTA, tip reporting |
| **Workers' comp** | Higher rates for restaurants |

### 4. Franchise Considerations

| Element | Accounting Treatment |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Initial franchise fee** | Capitalize; amortize over agreement term |
| **Ongoing royalties** | Operating expense |
| **Marketing/advertising fund** | Operating expense |
| **Leasehold improvements** | Required standards; capitalize |
| **Equipment purchases** | Capitalize; depreciate |
| **Franchise deposits** | Asset until applied or refunded |

## Compilation Considerations

### Financial Statement Presentation

#### Required Disclosures

| **Inventory** | Valuation method, categories |
| **Franchise arrangements** | Terms, fees, period remaining |
| **Lease information** | Terms, options, incentives |

| **Related parties** | Common in restaurant groups |

| **Gift cards not deferred** | Must defer until redeemed |
| **No breakage recognition** | Should recognize systematically |
| **Loyalty points ignored** | Must defer portion of revenue |
| **Inventory not valued properly** | Should be at lower of cost or NRV |
| **Missing lease disclosures** | Required under ASC 842 |
| **Franchise fees not capitalized** | Initial fees should be capitalized |

---

## Special Considerations

### Cash Controls and Fraud Risk

Restaurants are high-risk for fraud:

| Risk Area | Controls to Understand |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Cash sales** | Point-of-sale reconciliation |
| **Voids and comps** | Authorization, tracking |
| **Tips** | Credit card vs. cash tracking |
| **Inventory** | Physical counts, variance analysis |
| **Payroll** | Time clock, ghost employees |
| **Vendor kickbacks** | Purchasing controls |

### Third-Party Delivery

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|---------------|
| **Gross vs. net** | Is restaurant principal or agent? |
| **Commission fees** | Expense or reduction of revenue |
| **Timing** | When is performance obligation satisfied? |
| **Disputes** | Refunds, adjustments, chargebacks |

### Lease Considerations

Restaurant leases often include:
- Percentage rent clauses
- Exclusive use provisions
- Tenant improvement allowances
- Personal guarantees
- Lease incentives

---

## Common Peer Review Deficiencies - Restaurants

| Deficiency | Prevention |
|------------|------------|
| Tips included in revenue | Ensure pass-through tips excluded |
| Gift cards not deferred | Verify liability and breakage policy |
| Inventory not valued properly | Review valuation method |
| Cash basis accounting | Should be accrual for GAAP |
| Missing lease disclosures | Include ASC 842 disclosures |
| Labor costs not separated | Show as separate line item |
| Franchise fees expensed | Capitalize and amortize |
