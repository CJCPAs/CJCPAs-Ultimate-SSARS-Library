## Case Study 1: The Bookkeeping Dilemma

### Scenario

Your firm provides monthly bookkeeping services to ABC Company. They now need reviewed financial statements for a new bank loan. The bookkeeping includes:
- Recording journal entries
- Reconciling bank accounts
- Preparing monthly trial balances
- Making routine accounting decisions (classifying expenses, etc.)

The owner reviews and approves monthly financial reports but doesn't understand accounting details.

### Key Issues

1. Does providing bookkeeping impair independence?
2. Can you perform the review?
3. What would need to change to be independent?

### Analysis

**Independence Framework:**

| Threat Type | Present? | Explanation |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Self-Review | YES | Reviewing your own work |
| Management Participation | YES | Making accounting decisions |
| Self-Interest | Possible | Fee dependence |

**Key Factors:**
- Performing management functions (recording entries, making decisions)
- Client doesn't exercise meaningful oversight
- Client cannot take responsibility for accounting decisions

**Conclusion:** Independence is impaired.

### Resolution

**Option 1: Step Down to Compilation**
- Cannot perform review
- Can perform compilation with independence disclosure
- "We are not independent with respect to ABC Company."

**Option 2: Change Relationship for Future**
To achieve independence for future reviews:
- Client must make accounting decisions
- Client must review and understand entries
- Client must exercise meaningful oversight
- Bookkeeper provides data; client decides treatment
- Document client's understanding and involvement

**Key Takeaway:** Bookkeeping typically impairs independence for reviews when the client cannot oversee and take responsibility for accounting decisions.

## Case Study 2: The Family Relationship

### Scenario

You're asked to perform a review of DEF Corporation. During client acceptance, you discover:
- The CFO is your spouse's brother
- You and the CFO occasionally socialize at family events
- The CFO has been with the company for 15 years

### Key Issues

1. Does a family relationship impair independence?
2. Does it matter which family member?
3. Are there safeguards available?

### Analysis

**Independence Framework:**

Under AICPA Code of Professional Conduct:

| Relationship | To Whom | Independence Effect |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Spouse, dependent | Any position | Impaired |
| Close relative | Key position | Evaluate threat |
| Extended family | Any position | Evaluate significance |

**Brother-in-law Analysis:**
- Brother-in-law is NOT a "close relative" per AICPA definition
- "Close relatives" = parent, sibling, nondependent child
- Spouse's siblings are more extended relationship
- BUT must evaluate familiarity threat

**Familiarity Threat Evaluation:**
- Regular social interaction
- Long tenure at company
- Key position (CFO)
- Consider if objectivity could be affected

### Resolution

**Analysis Steps:**

1. **Identify the relationship precisely:**
   - Spouse's brother = brother-in-law
   - Not in "close relative" category

2. **Evaluate familiarity threat:**
   - How often do you interact?
   - Is the relationship close?
   - Would you be reluctant to challenge the CFO?

3. **Apply safeguards if threat is other than clearly insignificant:**
   - Second partner review
   - Remove from engagement
   - Document threat and safeguards

4. **Likely conclusion:**
   - If relationship is not particularly close, independence may be maintained with safeguards
   - If relationship is very close, consider declining
   - Document the evaluation

**Key Takeaway:** Not all family relationships impair independence automatically. Evaluate the specific relationship against AICPA definitions and apply the threats/safeguards approach.

## Case Study 3: Overdue Fees

### Scenario

GHI Company owes your firm $35,000 in fees for prior year services:
- $20,000 for last year's review
- $15,000 for tax preparation

The fees have been outstanding for 14 months. You've been asked to perform this year's review.

### Key Issues

1. Do unpaid fees affect independence?
2. When does this become a problem?
3. What are the options?

### Analysis

**Independence Framework:**

Under AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, unpaid fees are treated similar to loans:

| Condition | Independence Status |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Fees current | No issue |
| Fees overdue, not material | Evaluate threat |
| Fees overdue > 1 year (prior to current engagement) | Generally impaired |
| Overdue fees similar to loan | May impair independence |

**Self-Interest Threat:**
- Significant overdue fees = essentially a loan
- May affect willingness to challenge client
- May create pressure to issue favorable report

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Evaluate the facts:**
   - How long overdue?
   - How material to your practice?
   - Is there a payment plan?
   - What is collection likelihood?

2. **For fees overdue > 1 year:**
   - Generally, cannot begin current engagement
   - Must collect prior fees first
   - Document the issue

3. **Options:**
   - Collect fees before starting engagement
   - Decline engagement until fees paid
   - If performing, document evaluation and any safeguards
   - Consider if relationship should continue

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document fee status
   - Document independence evaluation
   - Document any safeguards applied

**Key Takeaway:** Significantly overdue fees (especially > 1 year) can impair independence. Collect before starting the next engagement or don't perform the review.

## Case Study 4: Financial Interest Through Retirement Plan

### Scenario

Your firm's partner pension plan holds diversified mutual funds. During the annual review of investments, you discover that one fund holds a 0.0003% position in JKL Corporation - a review client.

### Key Issues

1. Is this a financial interest that impairs independence?
2. Does materiality matter?
3. What about indirect investments?

### Analysis

**Independence Framework:**

| Financial Interest Type | Independence Effect |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Direct ownership of client stock | Impaired (any amount) |
| Direct investment in client | Impaired (any amount) |
| Indirect through diversified fund | Usually not impaired |
| Indirect through managed fund | Evaluate control |

**Diversified Fund Exception:**

The AICPA Code provides relief when:
- Investment is in a diversified mutual fund
- No control over investment decisions
- Investment is not material to net worth
- No position on fund's board

### Resolution

**Analysis:**

1. **Characterize the interest:**
   - 0.0003% holding in a diversified fund
   - No control over investment decisions
   - Clearly immaterial

2. **Apply guidance:**
   - This is an indirect interest
   - Through a diversified vehicle
   - No control
   - Immaterial to your net worth

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Independence is NOT impaired
   - This falls within the diversified fund exception
   - No action required

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document awareness of holding
   - Document application of diversified fund exception
   - Retain for engagement file

**Key Takeaway:** Not all financial interests impair independence. Indirect interests through diversified funds with no control are generally acceptable.

## Case Study 5: Management Decisions for Startup

### Scenario

A new entrepreneur asks you to help start their business. They want you to:
- Form the LLC
- Set up the accounting system
- Design the chart of accounts
- Recommend accounting software
- Train them on bookkeeping
- Then perform annual reviews

### Key Issues

1. Do these setup activities impair independence?
2. How can you structure the relationship?
3. What safeguards are available?

### Analysis

**Evaluate Each Service:**

| Service | Management Function? | Independence Impact |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Form LLC | Administrative | Not impaired |
| Set up system | Design function | Evaluate |
| Design chart of accounts | Accounting expertise | Generally OK with oversight |
| Recommend software | Advisory | Generally OK |
| Train on bookkeeping | Education | Generally OK |
| Make ongoing decisions | Management | Impairs if no oversight |

**Key Distinction:**
- Providing recommendations and advice: OK
- Making decisions for management: Impairs
- Training management: OK
- Performing management functions: Impairs

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Structure services properly:**
   - Provide recommendations, not decisions
   - Train client to make decisions
   - Document client understanding and approval
   - Client must take responsibility

2. **For system setup:**
   - Present options to management
   - Management makes final decisions
   - You implement management's decisions
   - Document management's involvement

3. **Ongoing relationship:**
   - Clear separation of responsibilities
   - Client reviews and approves your work
   - Client makes accounting decisions
   - You provide information and analysis

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document services provided
   - Document client's decision-making role
   - Document client's oversight
   - Maintain for independence file

**Key Takeaway:** You can help startups get set up without impairing independence IF you ensure management makes decisions and provides oversight. Document the distinction carefully.

## Case Study 6: The Advocacy Situation

### Scenario

Your review client MNO Industries is being audited by the IRS. They ask you to:
- Represent them in the IRS audit
- Negotiate settlement positions
- Advocate for their position on contested issues
- Then complete this year's review

### Key Issues

1. Does tax representation create advocacy threat?
2. Can you provide both services?
3. What are the limits?

### Analysis

**Evaluate Advocacy Threat:**

| Activity | Advocacy Level | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Preparing tax returns | Low | Generally OK |
| Responding to IRS inquiries | Moderate | Evaluate |
| Representing in audit | Higher | Evaluate significance |
| Advocacy in tax court | Highest | May impair |

**Tax Services Generally Permitted:**

The AICPA Code recognizes that tax services are different:
- Tax positions require advocacy
- This is expected and accepted
- Client is counterparty to IRS, not third party relying on statements

**BUT Consider:**
- Are positions taken on the return consistent with financial statements?
- Is there a threat to objectivity on financial statement matters?
- Is advocacy so aggressive it affects judgment?

### Resolution

**Analysis:**

1. **Tax representation:**
   - Generally, can provide tax representation
   - This is a normal part of tax practice
   - Advocacy in tax matters is expected

2. **Evaluate specific circumstances:**
   - Are tax positions affecting financial statements?
   - Is client asking you to take extreme positions?
   - Would representation affect your objectivity on financial statements?

3. **Likely conclusion:**
   - IRS representation generally doesn't impair independence
   - Financial statement review can proceed
   - Document the evaluation

4. **Red flags that would change analysis:**
   - Dispute directly affects financial statement amounts
   - Client asks for clearly improper positions
   - You lose objectivity on client matters

**Key Takeaway:** Tax representation generally doesn't impair independence for SSARS engagements. The AICPA recognizes the different nature of tax services. But evaluate if specific circumstances create threats.

## Case Study 7: Business Relationship with Client

### Scenario

PQR Company, your review client, approaches you about investing in a new business venture they're launching. They want you to invest $50,000 for a 10% interest in a subsidiary that will be consolidated with PQR.

### Key Issues

1. Does investing create a financial interest?
2. Would this impair independence?
3. What about loan relationships?

### Analysis

**Financial Interest Analysis:**

| Interest Type | Independence Effect |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Direct investment in client | Impaired |
| Investment in subsidiary consolidated | Impaired (derivative) |
| Material indirect investment | Evaluate threat |
| Business relationship as investor | Evaluate significance |

**This Situation:**
- 10% investment = material direct interest
- In consolidated subsidiary = related to client
- Would have financial interest in client's success
- Clear impairment

### Resolution

**Cannot Make Investment and Remain Independent:**

1. **If investment made:**
   - Cannot perform review
   - Independence is impaired
   - Financial interest is direct and material

2. **Alternative considerations:**
   - Could you provide compilation with disclosure?
   - Only if other firm doesn't need your independence
   - Still must evaluate relationship

3. **Declining the investment:**
   - If you want to continue as review accountant
   - Must decline the investment
   - Document the evaluation

4. **If already invested:**
   - Must either divest or stop performing review
   - Cannot have it both ways
   - Disclose in compilation if stepping down

**Key Takeaway:** Direct investments in clients impair independence. This includes investments in consolidated subsidiaries. You cannot be both investor and independent accountant.

## Case Study 8: Controller Joining Your Firm

### Scenario

STU Company's controller is leaving and wants to join your accounting firm. Your firm has performed STU's reviews for the past 5 years. The controller was in charge of:
- Preparing all financial statements
- Making all accounting decisions
- Serving as primary contact for your review

### Key Issues

1. Does hiring a former client employee affect independence?
2. What cooling-off periods apply?
3. Can you continue as review accountant?

### Analysis

**Employment Relationships - Former Client Employee:**

| Consideration | Application |
|---------------|-------------|
| Former employee in significant position | Evaluate relationship |
| Knowledge of client systems | Consider self-review |
| Continuing influence at client | Evaluate |
| Cooling off period | Consider for objectivity |

**AICPA Guidance:**

When hiring former client personnel:
- No specific prohibition
- Evaluate self-review threat
- Consider if former employee would review own work
- Consider appearance to third parties

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **You CAN hire the controller**
   - No absolute prohibition
   - But must evaluate threats

2. **Safeguards to implement:**
   - New employee should NOT work on STU engagement
   - Different engagement personnel
   - No self-review of prior work
   - Document the safeguards

3. **Consider timing:**
   - Controller's last work at STU
   - When does your review cover?
   - Minimize overlap where possible

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document the hiring
   - Document independence evaluation
   - Document safeguards applied
   - Assign engagement to others

**Key Takeaway:** Hiring former client employees is permitted, but apply safeguards. The key is ensuring no self-review and maintaining appearance of independence.

## Independence Decision Framework

```
INDEPENDENCE EVALUATION PROCESS:

Step 1: IDENTIFY the relationship, interest, or circumstance

Step 2: CATEGORIZE the threat type:
        - Self-review
        - Self-interest
        - Advocacy
        - Familiarity
        - Undue influence

Step 3: EVALUATE significance of threat:
        - Clearly insignificant? → No further action
        - Other than clearly insignificant? → Proceed to Step 4

Step 4: IDENTIFY available safeguards:
        - Firm-level safeguards
        - Engagement-level safeguards
        - Client-level safeguards

Step 5: DETERMINE if safeguards eliminate or reduce threat
        to acceptable level:
        - Yes → Document and proceed
        - No → Cannot perform engagement

Step 6: DOCUMENT the evaluation and conclusion
```
