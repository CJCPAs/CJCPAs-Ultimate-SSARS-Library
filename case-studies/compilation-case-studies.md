## Case Study 1: The Cash Basis Client Who Wants "GAAP" Statements

### Scenario

ABC Plumbing has been your compilation client for five years. They've always been on the cash basis. The owner calls and says the bank is now requiring "GAAP financial statements" for their loan renewal. The owner asks you to "just put GAAP on the report" without changing anything.

### Key Issues

1. Can cash basis statements be presented as GAAP?
2. What are the accountant's options?
3. How should this be handled with the client?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Cash basis is a special purpose framework (SPF), not GAAP
- GAAP requires accrual basis accounting
- Significant differences exist (A/R, A/P, prepaid expenses, accrued liabilities)
- The bank specifically requires GAAP statements

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 80.14: Report must identify the financial reporting framework
- Cash basis statements cannot be labeled as GAAP
- Misrepresenting the framework would be misleading

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Explain to client** that cash basis is not GAAP and cannot be presented as such.

2. **Offer alternatives:**
   - Convert to accrual basis (GAAP) for the compilation
   - Issue cash basis statements with proper framework disclosure and provide to bank
   - Contact bank to determine if cash basis with proper disclosure would be acceptable

3. **If converting to GAAP:**
   - Obtain accrual adjustments (A/R, A/P, prepaids, accruals)
   - May need to adjust prior period for comparability
   - Issue GAAP-basis compilation report

4. **Document:**
   - Client communication
   - Decision made
   - Framework used

### Key Takeaway

Never misrepresent the financial reporting framework. Cash basis is not GAAP, and presenting it as such could be fraud.

## Case Study 2: The Obvious Error Dilemma

### Scenario

You're compiling financial statements for DEF Manufacturing. While reading the draft statements, you notice that inventory is shown at $2.5 million, but you recall the client mentioned last month that they had a fire and lost most of their inventory. You inquire, and management confirms the inventory was destroyed but says the insurance claim is pending so they left the inventory on the books.

### Key Issues

1. Is this an "obvious error" under SSARS?
2. What are the required procedures?
3. Can you issue a compilation report?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Physical inventory was destroyed
- Insurance claim is pending
- Inventory carried at pre-loss value

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 80.11: Accountant should read financial statements and consider whether they appear free from obvious material errors
- Destroyed inventory cannot be carried at original value
- Proper treatment: Write off inventory, record insurance receivable (if probable)

**This IS an Obvious Error:**
- Inventory doesn't exist
- Clear departure from GAAP
- Likely material ($2.5M)

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Discuss with management:**
   - Explain proper accounting treatment
   - Inventory should be written off
   - Insurance receivable recorded if collection is probable
   - Gain/loss recognized for difference

2. **If management agrees to correct:**
   - Revise financial statements
   - Issue standard compilation report

3. **If management refuses to correct:**
   - Determine materiality of departure
   - Issue modified report disclosing the departure
   - Describe the departure and its effects (if determinable)
   - Cannot issue standard report

4. **Consider withdrawal** if management insists on materially misleading statements

### Key Takeaway

"Reading for obvious errors" is a real requirement. When you find one, you must act - either get it corrected or modify your report.

## Case Study 3: The New Client With No Records

### Scenario

A new client approaches you to compile financial statements for their restaurant. When you request the accounting records, they provide:
- A shoebox of receipts
- Bank statements
- Credit card processing statements
- No general ledger, trial balance, or prior financial statements

### Key Issues

1. Can you perform a compilation without organized records?
2. Who is responsible for the accounting?
3. What services are appropriate?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Client has source documents but no organized records
- No prior financial statements exist
- Significant accounting work needed to create financial statements

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 80: Compilation is assisting management in presenting financial statements
- Client must be able to take responsibility for the financial statements
- Bookkeeping is a separate service from compilation

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Clarify scope and responsibilities:**
   - Bookkeeping/write-up is separate from compilation
   - May provide both services, but they are distinct
   - Consider independence implications if also performing management functions

2. **Engagement letter should address:**
   - Bookkeeping services (if provided)
   - Compilation services
   - Separate fees if appropriate
   - Management's responsibility to review and approve

3. **Perform the services:**
   - Complete bookkeeping to create trial balance
   - Prepare draft financial statements
   - Have client review and take responsibility
   - Complete compilation procedures

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document both services
   - Evidence of client review and approval
   - Engagement understanding

### Key Takeaway

Compilation requires financial statements to compile. Bookkeeping is a prerequisite, not part of the compilation. Address both services clearly in the engagement.

## Case Study 4: The Independence Question - Bookkeeping Services

### Scenario

You've been doing monthly bookkeeping for GHI Retail for three years. They now need compiled financial statements for a bank loan. The owner says, "Just compile what you've been doing." You realize you've been making all accounting decisions and the owner just signs off on what you provide.

### Key Issues

1. Are you independent?
2. Can you compile these statements?
3. What changes need to be made going forward?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- You perform bookkeeping (management function)
- Client doesn't understand or review accounting decisions
- Client merely signs off without review

**Standards Application:**
- Independence not required for compilations (AR-C 80.14)
- BUT if not independent, must disclose
- Independence impairment: Performing management functions when client cannot oversee

**Independence Threats:**
- Self-review threat: Reviewing your own work
- Management participation threat: Making management decisions

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Assess independence status:**
   - Likely NOT independent due to:
     - Performing management functions
     - Client not exercising oversight
   - This is not necessarily disqualifying for compilation

2. **Can still compile, but:**
   - Must disclose lack of independence in report
   - Add: "I am (We are) not independent with respect to GHI Retail."
   - CANNOT include reason for lack of independence

3. **Going forward, to achieve independence:**
   - Client must review and understand accounting decisions
   - Client must be able to take responsibility
   - Document client's oversight activities
   - Consider having client make key accounting decisions

4. **If client needs review in future:**
   - Must be independent for review
   - Would need to significantly change relationship
   - May need to refer review to another firm

### Key Takeaway

You can compile for bookkeeping clients, but you're likely not independent and must disclose. Reviews require independence - a different standard applies.

## Case Study 5: Prior Period Error Discovery

### Scenario

While preparing current year compiled financial statements, you discover that last year's depreciation was calculated incorrectly, resulting in a $50,000 understatement of depreciation expense. The error is material to both years.

### Key Issues

1. How should the prior period error be handled?
2. What about the prior year compilation report?
3. What disclosures are needed?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Prior period error discovered
- Error is material
- You compiled the prior year statements with the error

**Standards Application:**
- ASC 250: Prior period errors should be corrected by restating prior periods
- AR-C 80.24: Consider subsequent discovery of facts

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Correct the error:**
   - Restate prior period retained earnings
   - Adjust comparative prior year (if presented)
   - Disclose nature and effect of error

2. **If issuing comparative statements:**
   - Restate prior year column
   - Include disclosure of error and restatement

3. **If issuing current year only:**
   - Adjust beginning retained earnings
   - Disclose the error and adjustment

4. **Prior year report:**
   - Original report should not be relied upon
   - If statements are reissued, issue new report
   - Consider communicating with known users

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document error discovery
   - Document correction approach
   - Document client communication

### Key Takeaway

Material prior period errors require restatement. Document the error, correction, and communications. Be prepared to address questions about why the error occurred.

## Case Study 6: Related Party Loans - Proper Disclosure

### Scenario

In preparing compilation financial statements for JKL Holdings, you notice a $500,000 receivable from the owner personally. The owner says it's "just internal" and doesn't need to be disclosed. The statements will go to a bank.

### Key Issues

1. Are related party transactions required to be disclosed?
2. What if management refuses to disclose?
3. What are the risks?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- $500,000 receivable from owner
- Clearly a related party transaction
- Bank will rely on statements
- Owner wants to omit disclosure

**Standards Application:**
- GAAP requires related party disclosures (ASC 850)
- Omission is a departure from GAAP
- Bank may make decisions based on incomplete information

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Explain requirements to management:**
   - GAAP requires related party disclosure
   - Nature of relationship
   - Description of transaction
   - Amounts involved
   - Terms and conditions

2. **If management agrees to disclose:**
   - Include proper disclosure in notes
   - Issue standard compilation report

3. **If management refuses:**
   - This is a known departure from GAAP
   - Must modify compilation report
   - Describe the nature of the departure
   - Cannot quantify if management prohibits

4. **Consider the circumstances:**
   - If omission appears designed to mislead bank
   - May need to consider withdrawal
   - Consult ethics guidance if fraud suspected

### Key Takeaway

Related party disclosures are required by GAAP. Omission is a departure that must be addressed in the report. Be alert to situations where omission may be intended to deceive.

## Case Study 7: Going Concern - Compilation Responsibilities

### Scenario

You're compiling financial statements for MNO Services. During the engagement, you learn that the company:
- Has negative working capital of $200,000
- Is three months behind on rent
- Lost their biggest customer (40% of revenue)
- Cannot make next month's payroll without new financing

The owner says "we'll figure it out" and doesn't want any going concern disclosure.

### Key Issues

1. What are going concern responsibilities in a compilation?
2. What if management won't disclose?
3. Can you still issue a compilation report?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Multiple indicators of substantial doubt
- Management unwilling to address
- No plan disclosed to mitigate

**Standards Application:**
- GAAP requires going concern evaluation and disclosure (ASC 205-40)
- Management must evaluate and disclose if substantial doubt exists
- In compilation, accountant doesn't evaluate - but must address known departures

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Discuss with management:**
   - Explain GAAP requirements
   - Management must evaluate going concern
   - If substantial doubt exists, disclosure required
   - If doubt is alleviated by plans, disclose the conditions AND plans

2. **If management properly evaluates and discloses:**
   - Include required disclosure
   - Issue standard compilation report
   - May consider emphasis paragraph (optional in compilation)

3. **If management refuses to evaluate/disclose:**
   - Known departure from GAAP
   - Modify report to disclose the departure
   - Describe the conditions creating doubt
   - Consider whether statements are misleading

4. **Consider withdrawal if:**
   - Management's position appears intended to mislead
   - You cannot appropriately modify the report
   - Association with statements creates unacceptable risk

### Key Takeaway

Going concern is a GAAP disclosure requirement. Even in a compilation, if you know about conditions and management won't disclose, you must modify your report.

## Case Study 8: The Substantially All Disclosures Omitted Compilation

### Scenario

A long-term client wants their annual compilation "without all those notes this year." They say "no one reads them anyway" and want to save money. The statements will be used for the owner's personal review only.

### Key Issues

1. Can disclosures be omitted in a compilation?
2. What must the report say?
3. Are there any restrictions on use?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Client requests omission of disclosures
- Statements for internal use
- Cost savings motivation

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 80.17-18: Substantially all disclosures may be omitted
- Modification to report required
- Cannot be done to mislead users
- Some disclosures cannot be omitted (e.g., going concern if applicable)

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Confirm appropriateness:**
   - Omission is not intended to mislead
   - No third-party reliance expected
   - Client understands limitations

2. **Report modification required:**
```
Management has elected to omit substantially all of the disclosures
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. If the omitted disclosures were included in the
financial statements, they might influence the user's conclusions
about the company's financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows. Accordingly, the financial statements are not designed
for those who are not informed about such matters.
```

3. **Note these items:**
   - Statement of cash flows may also be omitted
   - Framework (GAAP or OCBOA) should still be identified
   - Going concern disclosures should NOT be omitted if applicable

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document client's request and understanding
   - Confirm not intended to mislead
   - Note any required disclosures that are included

### Key Takeaway

Omitting substantially all disclosures is permitted in compilations with proper report modification. Ensure it's not done to mislead, and include any critical disclosures (like going concern).
