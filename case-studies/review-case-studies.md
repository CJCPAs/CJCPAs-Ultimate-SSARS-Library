## Case Study 1: The Analytical Procedure That Doesn't Make Sense

### Scenario

During your review of PQR Distribution, your analytical procedures reveal:
- Gross profit margin dropped from 32% to 18%
- Revenue increased by 25%
- Cost of goods sold increased by 55%

When you inquire, management says "That's just how it is this year." They offer no further explanation and become evasive when pressed.

### Key Issues

1. What is the accountant's responsibility when analytics reveal unexpected results?
2. What if management won't explain?
3. Can you issue the review report?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Significant unexpected fluctuation
- Management's response is inadequate
- No corroborating information provided

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 90.25: Analytical procedures designed to identify unusual relationships
- AR-C 90.28: If results are inconsistent with expectations, make additional inquiries
- Must obtain sufficient evidence to support conclusion

**The Problem:**
- A 14-percentage-point drop in gross margin is highly significant
- "That's just how it is" is not an adequate explanation
- Something is either wrong or requires disclosure

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Pursue additional inquiry:**
   - Request specific explanations for margin decline
   - Ask about pricing changes, cost increases, product mix changes
   - Request documentation supporting the explanation
   - Consider inquiries of others (CFO, operations manager)

2. **Perform additional procedures if needed:**
   - Analyze by product line or customer
   - Compare specific cost components
   - Review major vendor invoices
   - Consider whether inventory issues exist

3. **Evaluate management's responses:**
   - Are explanations plausible and consistent?
   - Is documentation available?
   - Are there other indicators of problems?

4. **If adequate explanation obtained:**
   - Document the explanation and your evaluation
   - Consider whether disclosure is needed
   - Issue appropriate report

5. **If management remains unresponsive:**
   - This is a scope limitation
   - Cannot obtain limited assurance
   - Consider qualified conclusion or withdrawal
   - Document extensively

### Key Takeaway

Analytical procedures are not just box-checking. When results are unexpected, you MUST pursue adequate explanations. "That's how it is" is never sufficient.

## Case Study 2: Management Refuses to Sign Representation Letter

### Scenario

You've completed all review procedures for STU Manufacturing. The financial statements are ready, and the report is drafted. When you present the management representation letter, the owner says, "I'm not signing anything that could get me in trouble. Just issue the report."

### Key Issues

1. Can you issue a review report without the management representation letter?
2. What are your options?
3. How do you handle the client relationship?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- All procedures completed
- Management refuses to sign representation letter
- Owner is concerned about liability

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 90.32: Accountant should REQUEST written representation
- AR-C 90.34: If management does not provide representations, the accountant is unable to complete the engagement
- This is a required element, not optional

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Cannot issue review report:**
   - Management representation letter is required
   - Without it, engagement cannot be completed
   - No exceptions or workarounds

2. **Discuss with management:**
   - Explain purpose of representation letter
   - Representations are what management already asserts
   - Not asking them to guarantee anything new
   - Standard professional requirement

3. **Explore the concern:**
   - Why is management reluctant?
   - Are there specific representations they object to?
   - Is there an underlying issue they're hiding?

4. **If still refuses:**
   - Withdraw from the engagement
   - Consider stepping down to compilation (no rep letter required)
   - Document the situation thoroughly
   - Consider implications for future relationship

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document discussions and management's refusal
   - Document withdrawal or change in engagement
   - Retain workpapers even if engagement incomplete

### Key Takeaway

No representation letter = no review report. Period. This is a firm requirement, not a suggestion. A refusal to sign often indicates deeper issues.

## Case Study 3: Discovering Fraud During the Review

### Scenario

During your review of VWX Services, you discover that the bookkeeper has been embezzling funds. Investigation reveals approximately $75,000 has been stolen over two years through fake vendor payments. Management was unaware until you brought it to their attention.

### Key Issues

1. What are the accountant's responsibilities when fraud is discovered?
2. How does this affect the financial statements?
3. What about prior period statements?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Material fraud discovered ($75,000)
- Two years of misappropriation
- Management was unaware
- Prior year statements affected

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 90.26(e): Inquire about knowledge of fraud or suspected fraud
- Fraud affects reliability of financial statements
- May affect prior periods compiled or reviewed
- Consider communication and reporting obligations

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Immediate actions:**
   - Communicate to appropriate level of management
   - If management is involved, communicate to those charged with governance
   - Document the discovery and communications

2. **Financial statement effects:**
   - Current year: Adjust for misappropriated amounts
   - Prior year: Consider restatement if comparative statements
   - Expense vs. asset: Likely expensed when stolen

3. **Prior period responsibilities:**
   - Consider effect on previously issued statements
   - If material, may need to advise of unreliability
   - Consider communication with known users

4. **Current year review:**
   - Obtain explanation of how fraud occurred
   - Consider completeness of fraud amount
   - Evaluate internal control deficiencies
   - Consider disclosure requirements

5. **Reporting considerations:**
   - May need emphasis of matter paragraph
   - Consider whether qualified conclusion needed
   - Ensure adequate disclosure
   - Consider consultation with legal counsel

6. **Legal/regulatory:**
   - No general legal reporting requirement
   - Consider if specific requirements apply (financial institutions, government)
   - Consult with counsel if uncertain

### Key Takeaway

Discovering fraud requires immediate action. Communicate to appropriate parties, evaluate financial statement effects, consider prior periods, and document thoroughly. Consult counsel if needed.

## Case Study 4: The Going Concern Dilemma

### Scenario

YZA Corporation has been your review client for years. This year:
- Net loss of $500,000 (third consecutive year of losses)
- Negative working capital of $300,000
- Loan in default, bank demanding payment
- Key customer (30% of revenue) just filed bankruptcy

The owner insists they'll "turn it around" and doesn't want any "going concern stuff" in the financials.

### Key Issues

1. What are going concern responsibilities in a review?
2. What if management disagrees with your assessment?
3. How should the report address going concern?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Multiple conditions raising substantial doubt
- Management is optimistic but no concrete plans
- Management resists going concern disclosure

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 90.26(j): Inquire about going concern
- Management must evaluate per ASC 205-40
- Substantial doubt must be disclosed
- Management's plans must be evaluated

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Document the conditions:**
   - Recurring losses
   - Working capital deficiency
   - Debt default
   - Major customer bankruptcy

2. **Inquire about management's plans:**
   - How will losses be reversed?
   - How will debt be addressed?
   - What replaces the lost customer revenue?
   - Are the plans feasible?

3. **Evaluate whether substantial doubt exists:**
   - Apply one-year look-forward period
   - Consider mitigating factors
   - Evaluate likelihood of plans succeeding

4. **If substantial doubt exists:**
   - Require disclosure in notes
   - If management won't disclose, this is a departure
   - Qualified or adverse conclusion may be needed

5. **Report options:**

   **If properly disclosed:**
   - May add emphasis of matter paragraph (optional)
   - Unmodified conclusion

   **If management refuses disclosure:**
   - Qualified conclusion for departure from GAAP
   - Describe the conditions and omission

   **If pervasive and no disclosure:**
   - Consider adverse conclusion
   - Consider withdrawal

### Key Takeaway

Going concern is a required evaluation. If substantial doubt exists, disclosure is required by GAAP. In a review, you must ensure this is addressed or modify your report.

## Case Study 5: Scope Limitation - Can't Observe Inventory

### Scenario

You're performing a review of BCD Wholesale, a distributor with $2 million in inventory (40% of total assets). The review started in March for the December 31 year-end. Physical inventory was counted on December 31, but you weren't there. Management says counts are accurate but can't provide any documentation of count procedures or reconciliation.

### Key Issues

1. Is physical observation required in a review?
2. Does lack of documentation create a scope limitation?
3. How should this be addressed?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Material inventory ($2M, 40% of assets)
- Review started after year-end
- No documentation of count procedures
- Unable to verify existence or valuation

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 90: Reviews consist of inquiry and analytical procedures
- Physical observation is NOT required in a review (unlike audit)
- BUT, must be able to obtain limited assurance
- Lack of corroboration may be scope limitation

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Perform alternative procedures:**
   - Inquire about count procedures
   - Review any available documentation (count sheets, adjustments)
   - Analytical procedures on inventory
   - Inquire about subsequent sales of year-end inventory
   - Consider gross profit margin analysis

2. **Evaluate if limited assurance can be obtained:**
   - Are analytical procedures sufficient?
   - Are management's representations reliable?
   - Is there any corroborating evidence?

3. **If sufficient evidence obtained:**
   - Document procedures and conclusions
   - Issue standard review report
   - Obtain specific representations about inventory

4. **If scope limitation exists:**
   - Modify report for scope limitation
   - Qualified conclusion describing limitation
   - Describe possible effects

5. **Consider engagement acceptance policies:**
   - For future engagements, discuss timing
   - Consider observation if inventory is material
   - Document expectations in engagement letter

### Key Takeaway

While physical observation isn't required in a review, you must obtain sufficient evidence for limited assurance. If you can't, it's a scope limitation requiring report modification.

## Case Study 6: Related Party Transaction - Fair Value Question

### Scenario

During your review of EFG Holdings, you discover the company purchased a building from the owner's brother for $800,000. Comparable properties in the area suggest the fair value is approximately $500,000. The transaction is disclosed, but the valuation difference is not addressed.

### Key Issues

1. How should related party transactions be evaluated in a review?
2. What if the transaction is not at fair value?
3. What disclosures are required?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Related party purchase
- Apparent above-market price
- Transaction disclosed, but not the valuation issue
- $300,000 potential overpayment

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 90.26(g): Inquire about related party transactions
- GAAP requires disclosure of related party transactions
- Material transactions should disclose terms and amounts
- Consider whether substance is appropriately reflected

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Inquire further:**
   - How was $800,000 determined?
   - Was an appraisal obtained?
   - What were the negotiation circumstances?
   - Why is price above apparent market?

2. **Evaluate management's response:**
   - Is there a valid explanation (improvements, special features)?
   - If truly overpaid, is this a distribution to related party?
   - What is the accounting substance?

3. **Disclosure requirements:**
   - Nature of relationship
   - Description of transaction
   - Terms and amounts
   - May need to disclose if not arm's length

4. **If terms are not arm's length:**
   - Consider if excess is disguised compensation/distribution
   - Consider if asset should be recorded at fair value
   - Ensure disclosure is adequate

5. **Report considerations:**
   - If properly disclosed and accounted for, standard report
   - If inadequate disclosure or improper accounting, modify

### Key Takeaway

Related party transactions require careful scrutiny. Inquire about terms and substance, ensure adequate disclosure, and evaluate whether accounting reflects the substance.

## Case Study 7: Prior Accountant Predecessor Communication

### Scenario

You've been engaged to perform a review for HIJ Corporation, a new client. The prior accountant performed compilations for the past five years. When you contact the predecessor:
- They won't return your calls initially
- When reached, they say "I can't discuss the client with you"
- They eventually say "there were issues" but won't elaborate

### Key Issues

1. What are predecessor communication requirements for reviews?
2. What if the predecessor won't communicate?
3. Should you accept the engagement?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- New client engagement (review)
- Prior accountant evasive/uncooperative
- Vague reference to "issues"
- Unknown what issues existed

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 90.16-17: Inquire of predecessor about whether to accept
- Communication is required before acceptance
- Predecessor may be limited by confidentiality
- Consider implications of no response

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Attempt communication:**
   - Written request with specific questions
   - Document all attempts
   - Request client authorize predecessor to respond

2. **If predecessor won't respond:**
   - Document attempts
   - Consider implications
   - This alone doesn't preclude acceptance
   - Heighten professional skepticism

3. **Due diligence alternatives:**
   - Inquiry of client about prior accountant relationship
   - Why did relationship end?
   - Were there disagreements?
   - Any issues with prior financial statements?

4. **Evaluate red flags:**
   - Why won't predecessor communicate?
   - Is client hiding something?
   - Were there integrity issues?
   - Are prior statements reliable?

5. **Acceptance decision:**
   - Weigh risks and information obtained
   - Consider additional procedures if accepting
   - Document basis for decision
   - May decline if too many red flags

### Key Takeaway

Predecessor communication is required but lack of response doesn't preclude acceptance. Use alternative procedures to evaluate the client, and document your acceptance decision thoroughly.

## Case Study 8: Stepping Down from Review to Compilation

### Scenario

You're in the middle of a review engagement for KLM Consulting when you discover your firm provided bookkeeping services that impair independence. The bookkeeping was done by another department without your knowledge. The client needs financial statements next week for a bank.

### Key Issues

1. Can you complete the review?
2. Can you step down to compilation?
3. What procedures are required?

### Analysis

**The Facts:**
- Independence impaired during engagement
- Bookkeeping services provided by firm
- Client needs statements urgently
- Review cannot be completed

**Standards Application:**
- AR-C 90.18-19: Must be independent for review
- If not independent, cannot issue review report
- AR-C 80: Compilation doesn't require independence
- Step-down is permitted

### Resolution

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Confirm independence is impaired:**
   - Evaluate the bookkeeping services
   - Was management oversight adequate?
   - Is impairment curable?

2. **Cannot issue review report:**
   - Independence is mandatory for reviews
   - No exceptions or disclosure alternatives

3. **Step down to compilation:**
   - Obtain new engagement letter for compilation
   - Explain to client the change in service
   - Client must understand difference in assurance

4. **Compilation report requirements:**
   - Disclose lack of independence
   - "We are not independent with respect to KLM Consulting"
   - Cannot disclose reason for lack of independence

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document discovery of impairment
   - Document client communication
   - New engagement letter
   - Complete compilation documentation

6. **Future prevention:**
   - Implement independence checking procedures
   - Cross-departmental communication
   - Pre-engagement screening

### Key Takeaway

When independence is impaired, you MUST stop the review. Stepping down to compilation is permitted with proper engagement letter and independence disclosure. Prevent future occurrences with better controls.
