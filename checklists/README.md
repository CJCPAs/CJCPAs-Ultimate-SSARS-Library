## Using These Checklists

### Best Practices

1. **Customize** - Adapt checklists to your firm and client
2. **Complete as you go** - Don't wait until end of engagement
3. **Document thoroughly** - Include explanations, not just checkmarks
4. **Review before issuance** - Have independent review of documentation
5. **Retain with workpapers** - Completed checklists are documentation
