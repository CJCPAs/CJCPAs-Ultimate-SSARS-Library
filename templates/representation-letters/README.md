## What If Management Refuses to Sign?

### Review Engagement

If management refuses to provide written representations:
1. **Cannot issue review report**
2. Consider whether compilation is appropriate
3. Evaluate relationship with client
4. Document the refusal and your response
5. Consider withdrawal from engagement

### Compilation Engagement

Since the letter is not required:
1. Document the refusal
2. Consider if it indicates broader issues
3. May still issue compilation report
4. Evaluate implications for engagement risk

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong date** - Review rep letters must match report date
2. **Missing representations** - Include all required elements
3. **Wrong signers** - Ensure appropriate management signs
4. **Generic language** - Tailor to specific entity circumstances
5. **Unsigned letter** - Get actual signatures before issuing report
6. **Backdating** - Never backdate the representation letter

---

## Customization Considerations

Add representations for:
- Industry-specific matters
- Complex accounting estimates
- Unusual transactions
- Known departures from framework
- Going concern considerations
- Specific matters identified during engagement
