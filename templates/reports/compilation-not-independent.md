## Key Points

### Required Independence Disclosure

The final paragraph **must** include:
```
I am (We are) not independent with respect to [Company Name].
```

### What NOT to Include

**Do NOT disclose the reason for lack of independence.** Per AR-C 80.21:

INCORRECT examples (do not use):
- "I am not independent because I own stock in the company."
- "We are not independent due to bookkeeping services provided."
- "We are not independent because my spouse is employed by the company."

CORRECT:
- "I am (We are) not independent with respect to [Company Name]." (Full stop)

### Title Consideration

Note: When not independent, some practitioners omit "Independent" from the title:
- "ACCOUNTANT'S COMPILATION REPORT" (not independent)
- "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT'S COMPILATION REPORT" (independent)
