2. **Missing independence disclosure** - Required when not independent
3. **Disclosing reason for lack of independence** - Not permitted
4. **Old report language** - Use current SSARS wording
5. **Incomplete disclosure omission language** - Include all required elements

### Review Reports

1. **Issuing review when not independent** - Cannot do this
2. **Wrong conclusion type** - Match to severity of issue
3. **Missing "not modified" statement** - Required for emphasis paragraphs
4. **Omitting independence statement** - Required in all review reports
5. **Effects not addressed in departure** - Must quantify or state undetermined
