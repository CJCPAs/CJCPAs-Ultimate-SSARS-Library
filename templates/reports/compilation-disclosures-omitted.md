### Cash Flow Statement

- May be omitted when substantially all disclosures are omitted
- If omitted, modify the report language accordingly
- Remove reference from first paragraph
- Add to disclosure omission paragraph

### Required Warning Language

Must include:
```
If the omitted disclosures were included in the financial statements, they might
influence the user's conclusions about the company's financial position, results
of operations, and cash flows. Accordingly, the financial statements are not
designed for those who are not informed about such matters.
