## Order of Paragraphs

When combining modifications, use this order:

1. **Standard opening paragraph** (management responsibility, compilation performed, no assurance)
2. **Disclosure omission paragraph** (if applicable)
3. **Known departure paragraph(s)** (if applicable)
4. **Independence disclosure** (if not independent) - ALWAYS LAST

---

## Key Points

### Multiple Departures

If there are multiple departures from the framework, each should be described in a separate paragraph.

### Independence Disclosure

- Always the final paragraph
- Never disclose the reason for lack of independence
- Use exact language: "I am (We are) not independent with respect to [Company Name]."

### Effects of Departures

State either:
- The effects of the departure (if known and quantifiable)
- "The effects of this departure on the financial statements have not been determined" (if not known)
