Dear [Client Name]:

### Engagement Purpose

This letter confirms our understanding of the terms and objectives of our engagement and the nature and limitations of the services we will provide.

### Services to Be Performed

You have requested that we review the financial statements of **[Company Name]**, which comprise the [balance sheet/statement of financial position] as of **[Date]** and the related statements of [income/operations], [changes in stockholders' equity/changes in members' capital], and cash flows for the [year/period] then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

We will conduct the review in accordance with **[accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP)]**.

### Our Responsibilities

We will conduct our review in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS) promulgated by the Accounting and Review Services Committee of the AICPA. A review includes primarily applying analytical procedures to your financial data and making inquiries of company management.

**The objective of a review engagement is to obtain limited assurance** as a basis for reporting whether we are aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial statements for them to be in accordance with **[applicable framework]**.

**We will:**
- Perform analytical procedures to the financial statements
- Make inquiries of management and others, as appropriate
- Obtain a written representation letter from management
- Issue a review report expressing limited assurance

**A review is substantially less in scope than an audit.** Accordingly:
- We will not obtain an understanding of internal control
- We will not assess fraud risk
- We will not test accounting records by obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence through inspection, observation, confirmation, or the examination of source documents
- We will not perform other procedures ordinarily performed in an audit

**Consequently, we will not express an opinion on the financial statements.**

### Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for:

1. **Preparation and fair presentation** of the financial statements in accordance with **[applicable framework]**; this includes the selection and application of accounting policies

2. **Designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control** relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error

3. **Preventing and detecting fraud**

4. **Identifying and ensuring compliance** with the laws and regulations applicable to the company's activities

5. **Making all management decisions and performing all management functions**

6. **Providing us with a written representation letter** that, among other things:
   - Confirms your responsibility for the financial statements
   - Confirms the financial statements are fairly presented
   - Confirms all known actual or possible litigation and claims have been disclosed
   - Confirms all related-party transactions have been disclosed
   - Confirms subsequent events have been considered

You are also responsible for providing us with:
- Access to all information of which you are aware that is relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements, such as records, documentation, and other matters
- Additional information that we may request from you for the purpose of the review
- Unrestricted access to persons within the entity from whom we determine it necessary to obtain review evidence

### Independence

We are required to be independent of **[Company Name]** to perform this engagement. We will maintain our independence in accordance with the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct and applicable ethical requirements.

If at any time we believe our independence may be impaired, we will notify you immediately, as we would be unable to continue the review engagement.

### Review Report

Upon completion of our review, we will issue a report on the financial statements. Our report will indicate the level of limited assurance obtained and will express a conclusion as to whether we are aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial statements.

If we become aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial statements and you do not make those modifications, we will modify our report accordingly. In some circumstances, we may determine it necessary to withdraw from the engagement.

### Limitations of the Engagement

Because a review is limited primarily to inquiries and analytical procedures, there is a risk that we may not become aware of material misstatements in the financial statements. A review does not provide assurance that we will become aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an audit.

### Management Representation Letter

As part of our review procedures, we will request that management provide us with a written representation letter confirming certain representations made during the review. The representation letter is a required element of a review engagement.

### Fees

Our fee for this engagement will be **[$XXX / based on our standard hourly rates / as agreed]**. This fee is based on anticipated cooperation from your personnel and the assumption that unexpected circumstances will not be encountered during the engagement.

**[Optional fee provisions:]**
- Invoices are due upon presentation
- A finance charge of X% per month will be assessed on any unpaid balance after 30 days
- In the event of nonpayment, you agree to pay all collection costs, including reasonable attorney's fees

### Other Terms
