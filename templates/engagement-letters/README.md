## Key Considerations

### Before Drafting the Engagement Letter:

1. **Determine service type** - Which level of service does the client need?
2. **Assess independence** - Are you independent? (Required for reviews)
3. **Identify framework** - GAAP, tax basis, cash basis, or other?
4. **Determine disclosures** - Full disclosures or substantially all omitted?
5. **Consider nonattest services** - Bookkeeping, adjustments, etc.?
6. **Evaluate risk factors** - New client? Complex entity?

### Independence Reminders:

| Service | Independence | If Not Independent |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Preparation | Not required | No disclosure needed |
| Compilation | Not required | Must disclose in report |
| Review | REQUIRED | Cannot perform engagement |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using old letter language** - Ensure current SSARS compliance
2. **Missing required elements** - Use checklists
3. **Wrong independence statement** - Match to actual status
4. **Inconsistent framework** - Same framework throughout
5. **No client signature** - Always get written acknowledgment
6. **Vague scope** - Be specific about what's included
