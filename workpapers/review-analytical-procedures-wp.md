## Detailed Analytical Procedures

### 1. Revenue Analysis

#### Procedure Performed:
Compared current year revenue to prior year, analyzed by major product line, and compared to industry trends.

#### Data Used:
| | Current Year | Prior Year | Change $ | Change % |
|-|-------------|------------|----------|----------|
| Product Line A | $3,200,000 | $2,900,000 | $300,000 | 10.3% |
| Product Line B | $1,800,000 | $1,750,000 | $50,000 | 2.9% |
| Product Line C | $1,000,000 | $950,000 | $50,000 | 5.3% |
| **Total Revenue** | **$6,000,000** | **$5,600,000** | **$400,000** | **7.1%** |

#### My Expectation:
Based on discussions with management regarding planned growth initiatives and the general economic environment, I expected revenue to increase approximately 5% overall.

#### Results:
Revenue increased 7.1%, which is higher than expected.

#### Inquiry and Follow-up:
Per inquiry of [Name, Title], the additional growth was primarily due to:
1. New customer contract signed in Q2 20XX with estimated annual revenue of $150,000
2. Price increase of 3% implemented in January 20XX

These explanations appear reasonable and are consistent with:
- Review of new customer contract
- Review of price increase memo dated January 5, 20XX

#### Conclusion:
Revenue increase is adequately explained by specific identified factors. No indication of misstatement.

### 2. Gross Profit Margin Analysis

#### Procedure Performed:
Calculated gross profit margin and compared to prior year and industry benchmarks.

#### Data Used:
| | Current Year | Prior Year | Industry Avg |
|-|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Revenue | $6,000,000 | $5,600,000 | N/A |
| Cost of Goods Sold | $4,020,000 | $3,640,000 | N/A |
| Gross Profit | $1,980,000 | $1,960,000 | N/A |
| **Gross Margin %** | **33.0%** | **35.0%** | **32-36%** |

#### My Expectation:
I expected gross margin to remain consistent with prior year at approximately 35%, based on stable product mix and no known significant changes in material or labor costs.

#### Results:
Gross margin declined from 35.0% to 33.0%, a 2 percentage point decrease.

#### Inquiry and Follow-up:
Per inquiry of [Name, Controller]:
1. Raw material costs increased approximately 8% during the year due to supply chain disruptions
2. The 3% price increase only partially offset the material cost increase
3. Labor costs increased 4% due to wage increases to retain employees

To corroborate:
- Reviewed commodity price index showing 7-10% increases in key materials
- Reviewed wage adjustment memo effective April 1, 20XX
- Recalculated: 8% material increase on ~50% of COGS = 4% impact; partially offset by 3% price increase and labor changes = approximately 2% net margin decline. This is consistent with results.

#### Conclusion:
Gross margin decline is adequately explained by documented cost increases and partial price recovery. Result is consistent with economic conditions and management's explanations. No indication of misstatement.

### 3. Operating Expenses Analysis

#### Procedure Performed:
Analyzed operating expenses by category as a percentage of revenue and compared to prior year.

#### Data Used:
| Expense Category | CY Amount | CY % Rev | PY Amount | PY % Rev | Change |
|------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Salaries & Benefits | $720,000 | 12.0% | $650,000 | 11.6% | $70,000 |
| Rent & Occupancy | $180,000 | 3.0% | $180,000 | 3.2% | $0 |
| Insurance | $85,000 | 1.4% | $70,000 | 1.3% | $15,000 |
| Professional Fees | $95,000 | 1.6% | $60,000 | 1.1% | $35,000 |
| Depreciation | $110,000 | 1.8% | $100,000 | 1.8% | $10,000 |
| Other Operating | $180,000 | 3.0% | $160,000 | 2.9% | $20,000 |
| **Total** | **$1,370,000** | **22.8%** | **$1,220,000** | **21.8%** | **$150,000** |

#### My Expectation:
Expected operating expenses to increase proportionally with revenue (approximately 5-7%) with no major changes to cost structure.

#### Results:
Operating expenses increased 12.3%, higher than expected. As a percentage of revenue, increased from 21.8% to 22.8%.

#### Inquiry and Follow-up:
Per inquiry of [Name, CFO]:

1. **Salaries & Benefits (+$70,000):** Added two employees (one salesperson, one warehouse worker) to support growth. Wages also increased 4% across the board. Reviewed payroll records - confirmed 2 new hires in Q1 and Q2.

2. **Professional Fees (+$35,000):** Legal fees for contract disputes ($25,000) and consulting fees for new ERP system selection ($10,000). Reviewed invoices for significant matters - confirmed.

3. **Insurance (+$15,000):** Premium increases on property and liability policies due to market conditions. Reviewed renewal notices - confirmed 18% increase.

4. **Depreciation (+$10,000):** New equipment purchases during year. Consistent with fixed asset additions reviewed.

#### Conclusion:
Operating expense increases are specifically explained by identifiable factors. Documentation supports management's explanations. No indication of misstatement.

### 4. Accounts Receivable Analysis

#### Procedure Performed:
Analyzed A/R turnover, days sales outstanding, and aging.

#### Data Used:
| Metric | Current Year | Prior Year | Change |
|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| A/R Balance (ending) | $850,000 | $700,000 | $150,000 |
| Revenue | $6,000,000 | $5,600,000 | $400,000 |
| A/R Turnover | 7.1x | 8.0x | (0.9x) |
| Days Sales Outstanding | 52 days | 46 days | 6 days |

**A/R Aging:**
| Age | CY Amount | CY % | PY Amount | PY % |
|-----|-----------|------|-----------|------|
| Current | $620,000 | 73% | $560,000 | 80% |
| 31-60 days | $150,000 | 18% | $100,000 | 14% |
| 61-90 days | $50,000 | 6% | $30,000 | 4% |
| Over 90 days | $30,000 | 4% | $10,000 | 1% |
| **Total** | **$850,000** | **100%** | **$700,000** | **100%** |

#### My Expectation:
Expected A/R balance to increase proportionally with revenue growth, with similar turnover and aging profile.

#### Results:
A/R increased 21% while revenue increased only 7%. DSO increased from 46 to 52 days. Aging shows more balances in older categories.

#### Inquiry and Follow-up:
Per inquiry of [Name, Controller]:

1. New customer contract (noted above) has 45-day payment terms vs. standard 30-day terms, contributing approximately $100,000 to ending A/R

2. One customer ($80,000 balance, $30,000 over 90 days) is disputing an invoice. Management believes full collection is probable after resolution expected in Q1 next year.

3. Management believes allowance of $25,000 is adequate based on historical collection experience and specific account review.

**Additional Procedures:**
- Reviewed subsequent collections - approximately $750,000 collected through [fieldwork date]
- Reviewed correspondence regarding disputed account
- Tested aging accuracy for selected items - agreed to invoices

#### Conclusion:
A/R increase explained by new customer terms and a specific disputed account. Subsequent collections support collectibility. Allowance appears reasonable. No indication of material misstatement.

### 5. Inventory Analysis

#### Procedure Performed:
Analyzed inventory turnover and compared to prior year.

#### Data Used:
| Metric | Current Year | Prior Year |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Ending Inventory | $730,000 | $610,000 |
| Cost of Goods Sold | $4,020,000 | $3,640,000 |
| Inventory Turnover | 5.5x | 6.0x |
| Days Inventory on Hand | 66 days | 61 days |

#### My Expectation:
Expected inventory levels to increase proportionally with sales activity, with similar turnover.

#### Results:
Inventory increased 20% while COGS increased only 10%. Turnover declined from 6.0x to 5.5x.

#### Inquiry and Follow-up:
Per inquiry of [Name, Operations Manager]:

1. Increased raw material inventory due to supply chain concerns - built safety stock of approximately $75,000

2. Increased finished goods to support expected Q1 sales of new customer

3. No known obsolescence issues - reviewed inventory aging, oldest items are moving products

**Additional Procedures:**
- Reviewed physical inventory count documentation - count performed 12/28/XX
- Inquired about obsolete or slow-moving inventory - none identified
- Reviewed subsequent sales of year-end inventory - inventory is turning

#### Conclusion:
Inventory increase explained by deliberate build-up of safety stock and finished goods for new customer. No indication of obsolescence or overstatement. Turnover decline is explained. No material misstatement indicated.

### 6. Debt and Interest Expense Analysis

#### Procedure Performed:
Analyzed relationship between debt levels and interest expense; reviewed covenant compliance.

#### Data Used:
| Item | Current Year | Prior Year |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Line of Credit | $200,000 | $150,000 |
| Term Loan | $450,000 | $500,000 |
| Total Debt | $650,000 | $650,000 |
| Interest Expense | $48,000 | $42,000 |
| Implied Rate | 7.4% | 6.5% |

#### My Expectation:
Expected interest expense to remain relatively stable given flat debt levels.

#### Results:
Interest expense increased $6,000 (14%) while debt levels remained flat.

#### Inquiry and Follow-up:
Per inquiry of [Name, CFO]:

1. Variable rate on line of credit increased during year due to Fed rate increases

2. Term loan is fixed rate - no change

**Covenant Compliance:**
- Debt-to-equity ratio requirement: < 2.0:1
- Current ratio: Debt $650,000 / Equity $900,000 = 0.72:1 ✓ In compliance
- Current ratio requirement: > 1.5:1
- Current: $2,100,000 / $1,200,000 = 1.75:1 ✓ In compliance

#### Conclusion:
Interest expense increase explained by variable rate environment. Covenant compliance confirmed. No material misstatement indicated.
