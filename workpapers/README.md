## Documentation Standards

### What Makes Good Documentation?

Documentation should be sufficient to enable an **experienced accountant**, having no previous connection with the engagement, to understand:
- The **procedures performed**
- The **evidence obtained**
- The **conclusions reached**

### Documentation Principles

1. **Contemporaneous** - Document as you work, not after
2. **Complete** - Include all significant matters
3. **Clear** - Understandable by someone unfamiliar
4. **Conclusive** - State your conclusions explicitly
5. **Connected** - Link evidence to conclusions

## Common Documentation Deficiencies

| Deficiency | Impact | Solution |
|------------|--------|----------|
| No expectation documented for analytics | Cannot evaluate results | Always state what you expected |
| Inquiry responses not recorded | No evidence of procedure | Document questions AND answers |
| Missing conclusions | Unclear if work was completed | State conclusion for each area |
| Generic procedures | Doesn't address specific entity | Tailor to the engagement |
| No follow-up documented | Unknown if issues were resolved | Document resolution of questions |
