## 🎯 Key Requirements

### 1. Ethical Requirements

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant should comply with relevant ethical requirements, including those pertaining to independence, when applicable." (AR-C 60.06)

**Plain English:**
Every SSARS engagement requires you to follow the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. This includes:
- Acting with integrity
- Being objective
- Using professional competence and due care
- Maintaining confidentiality
- Following independence rules (when applicable)

### 2. Professional Judgment

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant should exercise professional judgment in planning and performing an engagement performed in accordance with SSARS." (AR-C 60.07)

**Plain English:**
You cannot just mechanically follow a checklist. Every situation requires thoughtful consideration of:
- The specific circumstances of the engagement
- The nature of the entity
- The needs of the intended users
- Your own knowledge and experience

### 3. Conduct of the Engagement

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant should:
> a. plan the engagement so that it will be performed effectively;
> b. perform the engagement with professional competence; and
> c. comply with the requirements of the applicable section that are relevant to the engagement." (AR-C 60.08)

**Plain English:**
1. **Plan First** - Know what you're doing before you start
2. **Be Competent** - Have the knowledge and skills needed
3. **Follow the Rules** - Use the appropriate AR-C section requirements

### 4. Documentation Requirements

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant should prepare documentation sufficient to enable an experienced accountant, having no previous connection with the engagement, to understand the nature, timing, and extent of the procedures performed to comply with SSARS and applicable legal and regulatory requirements." (AR-C 60.12)

**Plain English:**
Your documentation should be complete enough that another CPA could:
- Pick up your files
- Understand what you did
- Understand why you did it
- Understand your conclusions
