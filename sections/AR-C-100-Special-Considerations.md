### Requirements for International Reporting

#### 1. Understanding the Framework

The accountant must obtain an understanding of:
- The applicable financial reporting framework used
- The intended users and jurisdictions
- Local regulations that may apply
- Any additional requirements in the foreign jurisdiction

#### 2. Report Modifications

| Situation | Report Consideration |
|-----------|---------------------|
| US GAAP statements for foreign use | Standard report; consider explaining US GAAP basis |
| Foreign framework for US use | Identify framework; consider disclosure needs |
| IFRS statements | Reference IFRS as the framework |
| Multiple jurisdictions | May need dual-framework presentation |

#### 3. Practical Considerations

**When Financial Statements Follow Foreign Framework:**

```
CHECKLIST: Foreign Framework Engagements

[ ] Obtain understanding of the foreign framework
[ ] Assess competence to apply the framework
[ ] Identify differences from US GAAP (if relevant)
[ ] Determine if reconciliation needed for US users
[ ] Consider whether report modifications are needed
[ ] Identify framework clearly in report
[ ] Consider regulatory requirements in both jurisdictions
```

### IFRS Considerations

The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) present unique considerations:

| IFRS Aspect | SSARS Implication |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Framework identification | Must be clearly stated in report |
| Full IFRS vs. IFRS for SMEs | Different requirements may apply |
| IFRS interpretations | Must understand and apply properly |
| Disclosure requirements | Different from US GAAP |
| US jurisdiction use | May need additional guidance for US users |

## Part 2: Reports on Application of Requirements of an Applicable Financial Reporting Framework

### Scope

This part of AR-C 100 applies when an accountant is asked by a party (other than the accountant's attest client) to issue a written report on:
- The application of requirements of an applicable financial reporting framework to a **specific transaction** (completed or proposed), or
- The type of report that may be issued on a specific entity's financial statements

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario A: Transaction Application Request**
- A company is considering a merger and asks an accountant (not their current accountant) how to account for it under GAAP.
- The accountant must follow AR-C 100 requirements.

**Scenario B: Report Type Request**
- A lender asks an accountant what type of report could be issued on a potential borrower's financial statements.
- The accountant must evaluate and report per AR-C 100.

### Requirements

#### 1. Understanding the Transaction

The accountant should obtain a thorough understanding of:
- The form and substance of the transaction(s)
- The relevant facts and circumstances
- The entity's specific situation (if applicable)
- The financial reporting framework that applies

#### 2. Consultation with Continuing Accountant

**Critical Requirement:**
> Before issuing a written report, the reporting accountant should consult with the continuing accountant to ascertain all available facts relevant to forming a professional judgment.

| Consultation Element | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| Contact continuing accountant | Obtain relevant facts |
| Document consultation | Record information obtained |
| Consider entity's circumstances | May affect application |
| Evaluate differences in fact | May result in different conclusions |

**If consultation is not possible:**
- Document attempts to consult
- Disclose in report that consultation was not possible
- Consider whether to proceed

#### 3. Responsibilities in the Report

The report must:
- Describe the engagement and its limitations
- Identify the transaction(s) addressed
- State the applicable financial reporting framework
- Describe the appropriate application of the requirements
- State that the ultimate responsibility for accounting treatment is management's
- Note that any difference in facts, circumstances, or assumptions could change the conclusion

### Report Format for Application of Framework Requirements

```
Report on Application of Accounting Principles

[Addressee]

We have been engaged to provide a written report on the application of
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(US GAAP) to [describe the specific transaction or type of transaction].

Our engagement was conducted in accordance with Statements on Standards
for Accounting and Review Services established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. We did not audit or review the financial
statements of [Entity] nor were we engaged to express, and we do not
express, any assurance on any financial statements of [Entity].

[If continuing accountant was consulted]
We consulted with [Entity]'s continuing accountant regarding [describe
matters consulted on].

[Description of transaction]
Based on our understanding, the facts relating to the transaction are
as follows: [describe facts].

[Conclusion]
Based on the facts as provided to us and our understanding of US GAAP,
we believe [describe the appropriate accounting treatment].

[Limitations]
The ultimate responsibility for the decision on the appropriate
application of US GAAP for an actual transaction rests with the
preparers of the financial statements, who should consult with their
continuing accountants. Our conclusion on the appropriate application
of US GAAP is based on the facts provided to us. If the facts and
circumstances of an actual transaction differ from those presented,
our conclusion may change.

[Signature]
[Date]
```

### Documentation Requirements

| Document | Content |
|----------|---------|
| Engagement documentation | Nature and scope of engagement |
| Facts obtained | Understanding of transaction |
| Consultation notes | Communications with continuing accountant |
| Research performed | Analysis of applicable standards |
| Conclusion | Basis for conclusion reached |

---

## Hypothetical Transactions

### Special Considerations

When the report involves a **hypothetical transaction**, additional caution is required:

1. **Clearly identify as hypothetical** - Report must state the transaction is hypothetical
2. **Describe assumptions** - All assumptions must be clearly stated
3. **Limitation language** - Strong language about actual transaction differences
4. **Avoid appearing definitive** - Cannot provide definitive guidance on hypotheticals

### Example Limitation Language for Hypothetical Transactions

```
This report addresses a hypothetical transaction based on assumed facts
and circumstances as described above. Actual transactions may vary
significantly from the hypothetical transaction described herein. The
accounting treatment for an actual transaction will depend on its specific
facts and circumstances, and our conclusion about the appropriate
accounting treatment for the hypothetical transaction described herein
may not apply to an actual transaction.
```

## Common Peer Review Deficiencies - AR-C 100

### International Reporting Issues

| Deficiency | Prevention |
|------------|------------|
| Framework not identified in report | Clearly state the framework used |
| Insufficient understanding of foreign framework | Obtain adequate training or consultation |
| No consideration of local requirements | Research jurisdiction requirements |
| Missing reconciliation when needed | Assess need for US GAAP reconciliation |

### Reports on Application of Framework

| Deficiency | Prevention |
|------------|------------|
| No consultation with continuing accountant | Always attempt consultation; document |
| Insufficient understanding of transaction | Obtain complete facts before concluding |
| Missing limitation language | Include required caveats in report |
| Appearing to give binding advice | Use appropriate disclaimer language |
| No documentation | Maintain adequate engagement records |

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: IFRS Financial Statements Compilation

**Situation:** A US subsidiary of a German parent needs financial statements prepared under IFRS for consolidated reporting purposes.

**Approach:**
1. Ensure competence with IFRS requirements
2. Obtain engagement letter specifying IFRS framework
3. Compile financial statements per IFRS
4. Issue compilation report referencing IFRS framework
5. Consider whether US entity needs US GAAP statements as well

### Example 2: Transaction Application Report

**Situation:** A potential acquisition target asks you (not their accountant) how a proposed earnout arrangement should be accounted for.

**Approach:**
1. Obtain detailed facts about the earnout structure
2. Contact the company's continuing accountant
3. Research relevant GAAP (ASC 805, Business Combinations)
4. Prepare report with:
   - Description of transaction
   - Applicable accounting guidance
   - Your conclusion
   - Appropriate limitations
5. Document the engagement thoroughly

### Example 3: Report Type Inquiry

**Situation:** A bank asks what type of report can be issued on a potential borrower's financial statements.

**Approach:**
1. Contact the entity's accountant (if any)
2. Understand the entity's situation, framework, records
3. Assess what level of service would be appropriate
4. Prepare report describing:
   - What levels of service are possible
   - What would be required for each
   - Any limitations or concerns
5. Include appropriate limitations about actual engagement

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **International reporting requires framework identification** - Always clearly identify the financial reporting framework
2. **Consultation is usually required** - Contact the continuing accountant before issuing reports on application of framework requirements
3. **Document thoroughly** - Maintain complete records of all AR-C 100 engagements
4. **Include limitations** - All reports must contain appropriate limitation language
5. **Assess competence** - Ensure you have adequate knowledge of foreign frameworks
6. **Hypothetical vs. actual** - Different considerations apply to hypothetical transactions
7. **Consider multiple jurisdictions** - International engagements may involve multiple regulatory requirements
