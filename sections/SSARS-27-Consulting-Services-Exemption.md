# SSARS No. 27: Consulting Services Exemption for Financial Statement Preparation

## Effective Date

**Effective for preparation of financial statements for periods ending on or after December 15, 2026**

*Early implementation is permitted*

---

## Overview

SSARS No. 27, issued April 2025, clarifies that a CPA preparing financial statements as part of a **consulting services engagement** performed under CS Section 100 is **not required** to apply AR-C Section 70, Preparation of Financial Statements.

**Plain English:** This is the "plain paper financial statement" standard. CPAs can now prepare financial statements for clients without the AR-C 70 legend when done as part of consulting services.

---

## The Historic Announcement

On April 3, 2025, at an AICPA town hall, the Accounting and Review Services Committee (ARSC) announced SSARS No. 27, declaring "a new era of client advisory services" has been launched.

**Why This Matters:**
- Removes a long-standing barrier to advisory services
- Allows CPAs to compete with non-CPA financial service providers
- Provides flexibility while maintaining professional standards
- Clarifies the boundary between attest and non-attest services

---

## What Changed

### Before SSARS No. 27
When a CPA prepared financial statements, they were **required** to either:
1. Apply AR-C 70 (Preparation) - include legend on each page
2. Apply AR-C 80 (Compilation) - issue compilation report
3. Apply AR-C 90 (Review) - issue review report

There was no option to prepare financial statements without applying SSARS.

### After SSARS No. 27
CPAs now have a choice:
- **Option A:** Apply AR-C Section 70, 80, or 90 (SSARS)
- **Option B:** Apply CS Section 100 (Consulting Services Standards)

---

## Key Requirements for Consulting Services Option

To use the CS Section 100 approach instead of AR-C 70:

### 1. Engagement Must Be Consulting Services
The financial statement preparation must be **part of a consulting services engagement**, not a standalone preparation service marketed as an alternative to SSARS.

**Examples of qualifying consulting engagements:**
- Business valuation requiring financial statements
- Transaction advisory services
- Strategic planning with financial projections
- Litigation support requiring financial analysis
- M&A due diligence
- Business consulting with financial reporting component

### 2. Follow CS Section 100 Requirements
The engagement must comply with Consulting Services Standards:
- [ ] Serve client interest while maintaining integrity and objectivity
- [ ] Establish understanding with client regarding engagement
- [ ] Use professional judgment
- [ ] Maintain appropriate documentation

### 3. No "Attest" Representation
The CPA must not:
- Issue a compilation, review, or audit report
- Make any representation about SSARS compliance
- Use language suggesting assurance was provided

## Comparison: AR-C 70 vs. CS Section 100

| Aspect | AR-C 70 (Preparation) | CS Section 100 |
|--------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Legend required** | Yes - on each page | No |
| **Independence required** | No | No |
| **Written engagement letter** | Yes (required) | Establish understanding (may be oral) |
| **Quality Management** | Subject to SQMS | Subject to SQMS |
| **Documentation** | Specific requirements | Professional judgment |
| **Report issued** | No report, just legend | No report |
| **Peer review** | Included in scope | May not be in scope |

---

## Decision Framework

### When to Use AR-C 70 (Preparation)

Use AR-C 70 when:
- [ ] Client specifically requests preparation engagement
- [ ] Financial statements will be provided to third parties
- [ ] Client needs SSARS-level documentation
- [ ] Engagement is standalone financial statement preparation
- [ ] Firm prefers standardized approach

### When to Use CS Section 100

Consider CS Section 100 when:
- [ ] Financial statements are incidental to consulting engagement
- [ ] Client is the sole user of financial statements
- [ ] Engagement is advisory/consulting in nature
- [ ] Client does not need SSARS legend
- [ ] Flexibility is important for client relationship

---

## Important Considerations

### 1. Quality Management Still Applies
**Critical:** Using CS Section 100 does NOT exempt firms from SQMS requirements.

All engagements performed by CPA firms, including consulting services, should be performed within the firm's quality management system.

### 2. Professional Liability Considerations
Discuss with your professional liability insurance carrier:
- Coverage for consulting services engagements
- Documentation expectations
- Risk management requirements

### 3. Engagement Documentation
While CS Section 100 has less prescriptive documentation requirements, prudent practice suggests:
- [ ] Document understanding with client
- [ ] Document scope of services
- [ ] Document significant findings or issues
- [ ] Retain appropriate records

### 4. Client Communication
Be clear with clients about:
- What service is being provided
- What the financial statements can be used for
- Limitations of the engagement
- Difference from preparation/compilation/review

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Business Valuation
**Scenario:** Client needs a business valuation for potential sale. Valuation requires preparing financial statements.

**Before SSARS 27:** CPA must apply AR-C 70 to financial statements, adding legend to each page.

**After SSARS 27:** CPA can prepare financial statements as part of valuation consulting engagement under CS 100. No legend required.

### Example 2: Strategic Planning
**Scenario:** Client engages CPA for strategic planning advisory. Project includes preparing projected financial statements.

**Before SSARS 27:** Projected financial statements required AR-C 70 legend.

**After SSARS 27:** Can be prepared under CS 100 as part of consulting engagement.

### Example 3: Monthly Financial Reporting (Standalone)
**Scenario:** Client wants CPA to prepare monthly financial statements for management use.

**Analysis:** This is likely a **standalone preparation service**, not consulting services. AR-C 70 would typically apply.

**SSARS 27 Impact:** Less clear - if structured as ongoing advisory/consulting, CS 100 might apply. Document the nature of the engagement carefully.

### Example 4: Litigation Support
**Scenario:** Attorney engages CPA to assist with commercial litigation, including preparing financial analysis and historical financial statements.

**After SSARS 27:** Financial statements prepared as part of litigation support consulting engagement can be done under CS 100.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use CS 100 for all financial statement preparations?
**A:** No. SSARS No. 27 applies when preparation is **part of a consulting services engagement**. Standalone preparation services should still follow AR-C 70.

### Q: Do I still need an engagement letter?
**A:** CS Section 100 requires establishing an understanding with the client. While this can technically be oral, written documentation is best practice.

### Q: What about independence?
**A:** Neither AR-C 70 nor CS 100 require independence when no report is issued. However, other ethical requirements always apply.

### Q: Will these engagements be peer reviewed?
**A:** It depends on your firm's peer review scope. Consulting services may fall outside the scope of system reviews focused on A&A engagements. Confirm with your peer reviewer.

### Q: Can I switch between AR-C 70 and CS 100 for different periods?
**A:** Yes, each engagement/period can be evaluated independently. Document your basis for the approach used.
