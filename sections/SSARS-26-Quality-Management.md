# SSARS No. 26: Quality Management for SSARS Engagements

## Effective Date

**CRITICAL: Effective for SSARS engagements for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2025**

Firms must have their Quality Management System designed and implemented by this date.

---

## Overview

SSARS No. 26, issued June 2022, aligns SSARS engagements with the AICPA's new Quality Management Standards. It moves from a rules-based "quality control" approach to a risk-based "quality management" approach.

**Plain English:** Instead of following a checklist of quality control policies, firms must now actively identify risks to engagement quality and design responses to address those risks.

---

## Key Standards Integration

SSARS No. 26 works in conjunction with:

| Standard | Focus | Applicability |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **SQMS No. 1** | Firm-level quality management system | All A&A firms |
| **SQMS No. 2** | Engagement quality reviews | When required by firm policy |
| **SSARS No. 26** | Engagement-level quality management | All SSARS engagements |

---

### AR-C Section 60 - General Principles

## Engagement Partner Responsibilities

Under SSARS No. 26, the **engagement partner** is responsible for:

### 1. Overall Engagement Quality
- [ ] Take responsibility for quality on each engagement
- [ ] Ensure compliance with firm's QM policies
- [ ] Determine that engagement team has appropriate competence and capabilities

### 2. Direction, Supervision, and Review
- [ ] Plan the nature, timing, and extent of direction and supervision
- [ ] Review work performed by engagement team members
- [ ] Ensure sufficient review before report issuance

### 3. Professional Judgment and Skepticism
- [ ] Exercise professional judgment throughout the engagement
- [ ] Apply professional skepticism (especially in reviews)
- [ ] Document significant judgments

### 4. Consultation
- [ ] Identify matters requiring consultation
- [ ] Consult on difficult or contentious matters
- [ ] Document conclusions reached from consultations

---

## Quality Management System Components

Firms must address these eight components under SQMS No. 1:

### 1. Risk Assessment Process
**What it means:** Identify quality risks specific to your firm and SSARS practice.

*Example risks for SSARS engagements:*
- Staff unfamiliar with AR-C requirements
- Failure to identify independence threats
- Inadequate analytical procedures in reviews
- Missing required report elements

### 2. Governance and Leadership
**What it means:** Firm leadership demonstrates commitment to quality.

*For SSARS practice:*
- Tone at the top emphasizing quality
- Clear accountability for SSARS engagements
- Resources allocated to SSARS training

### 3. Relevant Ethical Requirements
**What it means:** Ensure compliance with AICPA Code of Professional Conduct.

*Key areas for SSARS:*
- Independence (compilations with reports, all reviews)
- Integrity and objectivity
- Confidentiality

### 4. Acceptance and Continuance
**What it means:** Accept only engagements you can perform competently.

*Considerations:*
- Industry expertise
- Available resources
- Client integrity
- Independence threats

### 5. Engagement Performance
**What it means:** Engagements performed in accordance with standards.

*For SSARS:*
- Proper procedures performed
- Adequate documentation
- Appropriate reports issued

### 6. Resources
**What it means:** Sufficient resources to perform quality engagements.

*Resources include:*
- Human resources (staffing, competence)
- Technological resources (software, tools)
- Intellectual resources (guidance, templates)

### 7. Information and Communication
**What it means:** Relevant information communicated timely.

*Examples:*
- Standards updates communicated to staff
- Engagement issues escalated appropriately
- Client communication protocols

### 8. Monitoring and Remediation
**What it means:** Monitor the QM system and remediate deficiencies.

*Activities:*
- Inspect completed engagements
- Evaluate deficiencies
- Implement corrective actions

## Engagement Quality Reviews (EQR)

Under SQMS No. 2, firms establish policies for when EQR is required.

### When to Consider EQR for SSARS Engagements

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| **Public interest** | Entity significant to community |
| **Complexity** | Complex transactions or industry |
| **Risk** | Higher assessed engagement risk |
| **New staff** | Inexperienced engagement partner |

### EQR Requirements (When Applicable)
- Performed by qualified reviewer not on engagement team
- Completed before report release
- Evaluates significant judgments and conclusions
- Documents the review performed

---

## Documentation Requirements

### Firm Level (SQMS No. 1)
- [ ] Quality objectives documented
- [ ] Quality risks identified
- [ ] Responses to quality risks designed
- [ ] Annual evaluation performed and documented

### Engagement Level (SSARS No. 26)
- [ ] Evidence of review by engagement partner
- [ ] Consultation documentation (when applicable)
- [ ] Resolution of differences of opinion
- [ ] EQR documentation (when applicable)

---

## Scalability for Small Firms

**Important:** The QM standards are scalable. A sole practitioner's QM system will be simpler than a large firm's.

### Small Firm Considerations

| Large Firm Approach | Small Firm Alternative |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Formal quality committees | Partner oversight of all engagements |
| Multiple levels of review | Partner review of all work |
| Extensive written policies | Concise, practical policies |
| Separate EQR function | Second partner review or external reviewer |
| Complex monitoring program | Annual self-assessment |

**Key Point:** The system must address the risks, but the responses can be proportionate to firm size and complexity.

---

## Implementation Checklist

### By December 15, 2025:

**Firm Level:**
- [ ] Complete risk assessment for SSARS practice
- [ ] Document quality objectives
- [ ] Design responses to identified risks
- [ ] Establish policies and procedures
- [ ] Communicate to all personnel
- [ ] Implement monitoring activities

**Engagement Level:**
- [ ] Update engagement checklists for QM requirements
- [ ] Train staff on new responsibilities
- [ ] Update templates and forms
- [ ] Establish consultation protocols
- [ ] Define EQR policies (if applicable)

### Within One Year After Implementation:
- [ ] Evaluate whether QM system achieves objectives
- [ ] Document evaluation conclusions
- [ ] Remediate identified deficiencies

---

## Common Peer Review Findings (Anticipated)

Based on audit QM implementation, expect peer reviewers to focus on:

| Area | Common Deficiency | Prevention |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| Risk assessment | Too generic, not firm-specific | Tailor to your actual risks |
| Documentation | Insufficient evidence of review | Document partner review |
| Monitoring | No evidence of monitoring | Perform and document inspections |
| Training | Staff unaware of QM changes | Provide documented training |
| Independence | Threats not formally evaluated | Use independence checklists |

## Practical Tips for SSARS Practitioners

### 1. Start with Your Risks
Don't copy another firm's QM system. Identify YOUR specific risks:
- What types of SSARS engagements do you perform?
- What industries do you serve?
- What is your staffing situation?
- What technology do you use?

### 2. Keep It Simple
Your QM system should be:
- Understandable by all staff
- Practical to implement
- Proportionate to your practice

### 3. Integrate with Existing Processes
Build QM into your existing workflow:
- Add QM considerations to engagement acceptance
- Include QM documentation in workpapers
- Make monitoring part of annual planning

### 4. Document As You Go
Don't create documentation after the fact:
- Document decisions when made
- Record consultations immediately
- Note review completion in real-time
