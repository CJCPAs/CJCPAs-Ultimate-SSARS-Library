# AR-C Section 120: Compilation of Pro Forma Financial Information

## Overview

AR-C Section 120 provides guidance for engagements to compile pro forma financial information. Pro forma financial information shows what the financial statements "would have looked like" if a particular transaction or event had occurred at an earlier date. This section is specialized and applies specifically to pro forma presentations.

## 📜 Official AICPA Language

### Objective

> "The objective of the accountant when performing a compilation engagement for pro forma financial information is to assist management in presenting the pro forma financial information in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and report in accordance with this section without undertaking to obtain or provide any assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the pro forma financial information in order for it to be in accordance with the applicable criteria." (AR-C 120.03)

### Scope

> "This section applies when an accountant is engaged to compile pro forma financial information." (AR-C 120.01)

### Definition

> "Pro forma financial information—Financial information that shows the significant effects on historical financial information as if a consummated or proposed transaction (or event) had occurred at an earlier date." (AR-C 120.05)

## 📝 Plain English Interpretation

**What is Pro Forma Financial Information?**

Pro forma financials answer the question: "What would our financial statements have looked like IF..."

**Common Uses:**
- Business combination (merger or acquisition)
- Disposal of a significant business portion
- Change in capitalization (new debt, equity)
- Change in form of business organization
- Proposed transaction being evaluated

**Key Characteristics:**
- Based on historical financial information
- Adjusted for a specific transaction or event
- Shows "as if" the transaction occurred earlier
- Different from prospective financial statements (forecasts/projections)

**Example:**
> Company A acquires Company B on October 1, 20XX. Pro forma financial statements show what the combined company's results would have been if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 20XX.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I compile pro forma if I only prepared the historical statements?

No. AR-C 120 requires that you have compiled, reviewed, or audited the historical financial statements. Preparation engagements (AR-C 70) do not qualify.

### Can another CPA compile the pro forma if we audited the historical statements?

The standard requires that the accountant compiling the pro forma financial information be the one who compiled, reviewed, or audited the historical statements. However, the other CPA could use the audited statements as a basis if appropriate arrangements are made.

### What is the difference between pro forma and forecasts?

Pro forma shows effects of a transaction on historical information ("what would have been"). Forecasts predict future results ("what will be"). Different standards apply.

### Must assumptions be disclosed?

Yes. All significant assumptions used in developing pro forma adjustments must be clearly disclosed in the notes or summary of assumptions.

### Can I include pro forma with regular compiled financial statements?

Yes, but each requires its own report language. The pro forma compilation report is specific to pro forma information.

### What if the historical statements are more than one year old?

Consider whether the historical statements are still relevant for the pro forma presentation. Stale historical data may not provide meaningful pro forma information.
