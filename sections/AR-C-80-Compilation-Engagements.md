# AR-C Section 80: Compilation Engagements

## Overview

AR-C Section 80 provides guidance for compilation engagements. A compilation engagement involves presenting in the form of financial statements, information that is the representation of management without undertaking to express any assurance on the statements. Unlike a preparation engagement, a compilation requires the accountant to issue a report.

## 📜 Official AICPA Language

### Objective

> "The objective of the accountant in a compilation engagement is to apply accounting and financial reporting expertise to assist management in the presentation of financial statements and report in accordance with this section without undertaking to obtain or provide any assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements in order for the statements to be in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework." (AR-C 80.02)

### Scope

> "This section applies when an accountant is engaged to perform a compilation engagement." (AR-C 80.01)

### Definition

> "Compilation engagement—An engagement to apply accounting and financial reporting expertise to assist management in the presentation of financial statements without obtaining or providing any assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements in order for the statements to be in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework." (AR-C 80.05)

## 📝 Plain English Interpretation

**What AR-C 80 Means for You:**

A compilation is a step up from a preparation engagement. You're still not verifying the information, but you are:
- Applying your accounting expertise
- Assisting management in presenting financial statements
- Issuing a formal report
- Stating no assurance is provided

**Think of It This Way:**
- **Preparation** = Format the information, add legend, no report
- **Compilation** = Same formatting + professional report stating no assurance

**Key Distinction:** A compilation report accompanies the financial statements.

## 🎯 Independence Requirements

### Official Language

> "When performing compilation engagements, the accountant is not required to be independent of the entity for which the accountant is reporting." (AR-C 80.14)

> "When the accountant is not independent, the accountant's compilation report should specifically disclose that the accountant is not independent... The accountant should not include the reason for the lack of independence in this disclosure." (AR-C 80.21)

### Plain English

**Independence is NOT required for compilation engagements, BUT:**

1. If you are NOT independent, you must disclose this fact in your report
2. You cannot disclose WHY you're not independent
3. You may optionally disclose the reason, but this is not required or recommended

### Independence Disclosure Example

If not independent, add this paragraph to your report:

```
I am (We are) not independent with respect to XYZ Company.
```

**That's it!** Do not add reasons like:
- ❌ "...because I have a financial interest in the company"
- ❌ "...because my spouse is an employee"
- ❌ "...because I provide bookkeeping services"

## 📋 Engagement Requirements

### 1. Engagement Letter (Required)

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant should agree upon the terms of the engagement with management or those charged with governance, as appropriate... [T]he agreed-upon terms of the engagement should be documented in an engagement letter or other suitable written agreement." (AR-C 80.07)

**Required Contents:**

### 2. Understanding the Entity

**Official Language:**
> "Prior to the issuance of the compilation report, the accountant should obtain an understanding of the entity sufficient to enable the accountant to apply accounting and financial reporting expertise to assist management in the presentation of financial statements." (AR-C 80.10)

**What This Means:**
- Understand the client's industry
- Know the entity's operations
- Understand significant accounting policies
- Be familiar with the applicable financial reporting framework

### 3. Reading the Financial Statements

**Official Language:**
> "Prior to the issuance of the compilation report, the accountant should read the financial statements and consider whether such financial statements appear to be appropriate in form and free from obvious material errors." (AR-C 80.11)

**Plain English:**
You should:
- Read through the financial statements
- Look for obvious errors
- Consider whether format is appropriate
- NOT perform verification procedures

### 4. Management's Knowledge and Responsibilities

**Official Language:**
> "If the accountant becomes aware that the financial statements do not adequately refer to or describe the applicable financial reporting framework, the accountant should inform management." (AR-C 80.12)

Management is responsible for:
- The content of the financial statements

## 📄 Compilation Reports

### Standard Compilation Report

**Official Language Provides Standard Report Format:**

```
Management is responsible for the accompanying financial statements of 
XYZ Company, which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 20XX, 
and the related statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity, 
and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the 
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. I (We) have performed a 
compilation engagement in accordance with Statements on Standards for 
Accounting and Review Services promulgated by the Accounting and Review 
Services Committee of the AICPA. I (We) did not audit or review the 
financial statements nor was (were) I (we) required to perform any 
procedures to verify the accuracy or completeness of the information 
provided by management. I (We) do not express an opinion, a conclusion, 
nor provide any form of assurance on these financial statements.

[Signature of accounting firm or accountant, as appropriate]

[Accountant's city and state]

[Date of the accountant's report]
```

### Compilation Report - Not Independent

When not independent, add this sentence after the standard report language:

```
I am (We are) not independent with respect to XYZ Company.
```

### Compilation Report - Substantially All Disclosures Omitted

When disclosures are omitted, add:

```
Management has elected to omit substantially all the disclosures 
(and the statement of cash flows) required by accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America. If the omitted 
disclosures were included in the financial statements, they might 
influence the user's conclusions about the company's financial 
position, results of operations, and cash flows. Accordingly, the 
financial statements are not designed for those who are not informed 
about such matters.
```

### Compilation Report - Known Departure from Framework

When there is a known departure from the applicable financial reporting framework:

```
Management has elected to omit substantially all the disclosures 
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America. If the omitted disclosures were included in the 
financial statements, they might influence the user's conclusions 
about the company's financial position, results of operations, and 
cash flows. Accordingly, the financial statements are not designed 
for those who are not informed about such matters.

Additionally, as disclosed in Note X to the financial statements, 
the company has not capitalized the cost of certain leasehold 
improvements, which is a departure from accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America. The effects of 
this departure on the financial statements have not been determined.
```

### With Substantially All Disclosures Omitted

**Official Language:**

**Requirements:**
1. Must disclose the omission in the report
2. State that if included, disclosures might influence user's conclusions

## ⚠️ Departures from the Financial Reporting Framework

### Known Departures

**Official Language:**
> "If the accountant becomes aware that the financial statements are materially misstated, the accountant should propose appropriate revisions to management. If management does not make the revisions, the accountant should consider whether modification of the standard report is adequate to disclose the departure." (AR-C 80.19)

**Process:**
1. Become aware of departure
2. Propose corrections to management
3. If management refuses:
   - Modify report to disclose departure

### What if management won't correct a material misstatement?
