# AR-C Section 110: Compilation of Specified Elements, Accounts, or Items of a Financial Statement

## Overview

AR-C Section 110 provides guidance when an accountant is engaged to compile **specified elements, accounts, or items** of a financial statement rather than complete financial statements. This section addresses situations where only a portion of financial information is needed.

---

## Scope and Applicability

This section applies to compilations of:
- **Specified elements** - Such as revenue, gross profit, or net income

## Key Requirements

### 1. Engagement Letter

An engagement letter is **required** and should include:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Objective** | Compile specified element(s), account(s), or item(s) |
| **Identification** | Specific elements/accounts/items to be compiled |
| **Framework** | Applicable financial reporting framework or basis |
| **Management responsibilities** | Providing accurate information, fair presentation |
| **Accountant responsibilities** | Compiling information per SSARS |
| **Limitations** | No assurance provided |
| **Report** | Expected form and content |

### Sample Engagement Letter Provisions

```
Engagement Letter - Compilation of Specified Elements

We will compile [describe specific element/account/item] of [Entity Name]
for the [period/date] in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America [or other specified framework].

Our compilation will be performed in accordance with Statements on Standards
for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS) issued by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. A compilation is limited to presenting
information that is the representation of management in the form of
[element/account/item]. We will not audit or review the [element/account/item]
or the financial statements from which it is derived, and accordingly, we
will not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on it.

Management is responsible for:
• Preparing and presenting the [element/account/item] in accordance with
  [applicable framework]
• Providing accurate and complete information
• The selection and application of accounting principles
• Ensuring the [element/account/item] is free from material misstatement

Our responsibility is to compile the [element/account/item] in accordance
with SSARS. Our report will not express any assurance on the
[element/account/item].
```

### 2. Understanding Requirements

The accountant should obtain an understanding of:

- **The specified element(s)** - What is being compiled
- **The applicable framework** - How the element should be measured
- **The basis of accounting** - Consistent with overall framework
- **Relevant contracts or agreements** - If compliance-related
- **Entity's accounting policies** - For the specific element

### 3. Performance Requirements

**Similar to regular compilations:**

| Requirement | Application to Specified Elements |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Read the information | Consider if appropriate in form |
| Obvious errors | Look for obvious material errors |
| Framework appropriateness | Ensure proper measurement/presentation |
| Departures | Consider known departures |
| Independence | Not required; disclose if not independent |

---

## Relationship to Full Financial Statements

### Important Consideration

AR-C 110 compilations may be performed:
- **In conjunction with** a compilation of complete financial statements
- **Independent of** any engagement on complete financial statements

### When Full Financial Statements Are Also Compiled

If you compile both full financial statements and specified elements:
- The specified element compilation is separate
- Issues in one may affect the other
- Report on each separately (or combined if appropriate)

### When Full Financial Statements Are NOT Compiled

You may compile specified elements even if you:
- Have not compiled the full financial statements
- Another accountant compiles/reviews/audits the financial statements
- No engagement exists on the full financial statements

---

## Report Requirements

### Standard Report Elements

The compilation report on specified elements should include:

1. **Title** - Including "Independent" if independent
2. **Addressee** - Appropriate recipients
3. **Identification** - Specify what was compiled
4. **Period/Date** - Time frame covered
5. **Management's responsibility** - For the specified element
6. **Accountant's responsibility** - Compilation per SSARS
7. **Statement of no assurance** - No opinion or assurance
8. **Framework identification** - How element is measured
9. **Signature** - Firm or individual
10. **Date** - Date of report

### Sample Compilation Report - Specified Elements

```
Independent Accountant's Compilation Report

To the Management of XYZ Company

We have compiled the accompanying schedule of gross revenues of XYZ Company
for the year ended December 31, 20XX. We have not audited or reviewed the
schedule of gross revenues and, accordingly, do not express an opinion or
provide any assurance about whether the schedule is in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the
schedule of gross revenues in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and for designing, implementing,
and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of the schedule.

Our responsibility is to conduct the compilation in accordance with Statements
on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants. The objective of a compilation is to assist
management in presenting the schedule of gross revenues in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

[Accountant's signature]
[City, State]
[Date]
```

### Report Modifications

#### Not Independent

If the accountant is not independent:

```
[Add at the end of the report:]

I am (We are) not independent with respect to XYZ Company.
```

#### Known Departure from Framework

If there is a known departure:

```
[Add before the signature:]

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
require [describe required treatment]. Management has informed us that
[describe the departure]. The effects of this departure on the schedule
of gross revenues have not been determined.
```

---

## Special Considerations

### Contractual Basis Compilations

When the specified element is compiled pursuant to a contractual arrangement:

**Additional considerations:**
- Understand the contract requirements
- Ensure element is measured per contract terms
- Consider if contract basis differs from GAAP
- Disclose any departures from contract requirements
- May need to restrict use of report

**Example:** Compiling gross revenues for franchise royalty calculation where the franchise agreement defines "gross revenues" differently than GAAP.

### Tax Basis Compilations

When compiling specified elements on a tax basis:

- Identify the tax framework clearly
- Ensure consistency with tax return treatment
- Consider relevant tax regulations
- Disclose the basis in the report

### Multiple Specified Elements

When compiling multiple elements in one engagement:

```
Report Options:

Option 1: Single report covering all elements
• "We have compiled the accompanying schedules of [list elements]..."

Option 2: Separate reports for each element
• Individual reports for each element
• May be preferred if elements serve different purposes
```

---

## Documentation Requirements

### Required Documentation

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Engagement letter** | Signed agreement specifying elements |
| **Understanding obtained** | Knowledge of entity and elements |
| **Elements compiled** | The specified elements themselves |
| **Compilation report** | Report issued |
| **Significant matters** | Any issues encountered |
| **Independence assessment** | Evaluation of independence |

### Best Practices

- Reference the contract or agreement if compliance-related
- Document understanding of how element is measured
- Note any differences from how element would appear in full financials
- Document any departures and how addressed

---

## Common Peer Review Deficiencies

| Deficiency | Prevention |
|------------|------------|
| Missing or inadequate engagement letter | Ensure letter specifies exact elements |
| Element not clearly identified | Precisely describe what is compiled |
| Framework not specified | Clearly state the measurement basis |
| Missing independence disclosure | Disclose if not independent |
| Inadequate documentation | Document understanding and procedures |
| Departures not addressed | Identify and report departures |

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Royalty Schedule Compilation

**Situation:** A publisher needs a schedule of sales subject to author royalties.

**Approach:**
1. Obtain engagement letter specifying "sales subject to royalties" as defined in the author agreement
2. Understand the royalty agreement's definition of covered sales
3. Obtain sales data from management
4. Compile the schedule per the agreement's definitions
5. Issue compilation report referencing the contractual basis

### Example 2: Gross Receipts for Tax Purposes

**Situation:** A business needs a gross receipts compilation for local tax filing.

**Approach:**
1. Obtain engagement letter specifying gross receipts
2. Understand local tax definition of gross receipts
3. Compile gross receipts per tax definition (may differ from GAAP revenue)
4. Issue report identifying the tax basis

### Example 3: Revenue for Covenant Compliance

**Situation:** Bank requires a schedule of revenue for debt covenant calculation.

**Approach:**
1. Review loan agreement's revenue definition
2. Obtain engagement letter referencing covenant requirement
3. Compile revenue per loan agreement definitions
4. Issue report, potentially with restricted use paragraph

### Example 4: Profit Participation Schedule

**Situation:** Joint venture partner needs a schedule of distributable profits.

**Approach:**
1. Review JV agreement's profit calculation methodology
2. Obtain engagement letter specifying the schedule
3. Compile distributable profits per agreement
4. Issue report referencing the contractual basis

## Differences from Full Financial Statement Compilation

| Aspect | Full Financials (AR-C 80) | Specified Elements (AR-C 110) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Scope** | Complete financial statements | Specific elements only |
| **Engagement letter** | Required | Required |
| **Independence** | Not required; disclose | Not required; disclose |
| **Report** | Full compilation report | Element-specific report |
| **Use** | General purpose | Often specific purpose |
| **Framework** | Full GAAP or other | May be contractual/partial |

---

## Integration with Other Engagements

### Specified Elements + Full Compilation

When performing both:
- Separate engagement letters (or combined with clear scope)
- May issue combined or separate reports
- Issues in one may affect the other
- Document both engagements adequately

### Specified Elements Alone

When only compiling elements:
- No requirement to compile full financials
- Must still understand entity and element
- Report stands alone
- Consider if specified elements could be misleading without context

---

## Restricted Use Reports

### When to Consider Restriction

Some specified element reports may warrant restriction:

- Contractual calculations with special definitions
- Regulatory-specific measurements
- Internal-use schedules
- Compliance-related computations

### Restricted Use Language

```
[Add after the accountant's responsibility paragraph:]

This report is intended solely for the information and use of
[identify specified parties, e.g., management of XYZ Company and ABC Bank]
and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than
these specified parties.
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Clearly identify what's being compiled** - Specify exact elements, accounts, or items
2. **Understand the measurement basis** - May be GAAP, contractual, tax, or other
3. **Engagement letter is essential** - Must clearly define scope
4. **Independence not required** - But disclose if not independent
5. **Departures require disclosure** - Just like full compilations
6. **Documentation is required** - Maintain adequate records
7. **Consider restricted use** - When element has specific purpose or users
