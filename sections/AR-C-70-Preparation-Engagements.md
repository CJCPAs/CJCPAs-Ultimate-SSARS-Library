# AR-C Section 70: Preparation of Financial Statements

## Overview

AR-C Section 70 provides guidance for engagements to prepare financial statements for an entity. A preparation engagement is the most basic SSARS service level – the accountant assists management in presenting financial information in the form of financial statements without undertaking to provide any assurance on those financial statements.

## 📜 Official AICPA Language

### Objective

> "The objective of the accountant in a preparation engagement is to prepare financial statements in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework based upon information provided by management. These standards do not require the accountant to verify the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by management or otherwise gather evidence to express an opinion or a conclusion on the financial statements." (AR-C 70.02)

### Scope

> "This section applies when an accountant in public practice is engaged to prepare financial statements for an entity." (AR-C 70.01)

### Definition of Preparation

> "Preparation of financial statements is providing a nonattest service to an entity consisting of presenting to management or those charged with governance financial information that the entity has provided and formatted in the form of financial statements, without undertaking to provide any assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements in order for the statements to be in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework." (AR-C 70.A1)

## 📝 Plain English Interpretation

**What AR-C 70 Means for You:**

A preparation engagement is exactly what it sounds like – you're preparing financial statements from information the client gives you. Think of it as:
- Taking client data (trial balance, adjusting entries)
- Formatting it into financial statements
- Adding a legend that says "no assurance is provided"
- NOT providing any assurance on the accuracy

**Key Takeaway:** You're helping present information, not verifying it.

**When to Use Preparation:**
- Client needs internal financial statements
- No third parties require assurance
- Most cost-effective CPA service
- Client wants professional presentation without review or compilation

---

## 🎯 Independence Requirements

### Official Language

> "When performing preparation engagements, the accountant is not required to be independent of the entity for which the accountant is preparing financial statements." (AR-C 70.05)

### Plain English

**Independence is NOT required for preparation engagements.**

This means you can:
- Own stock in the client company
- Have family relationships with client personnel
- Have other relationships that would impair independence

No disclosure of independence impairment is required in a preparation engagement.

## 📋 Engagement Requirements

### 1. Engagement Letter (Required)

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant should agree upon the terms of the engagement with management or those charged with governance, as appropriate, and document such agreed-upon terms in an engagement letter or other suitable written agreement." (AR-C 70.06)

**Required Contents:**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Objective and scope** | Prepare financial statements per specified framework |
| **Management responsibilities** | Accuracy and completeness of information provided |
| **Accountant responsibilities** | Prepare statements based on information provided |
| **Limitations of engagement** | No assurance provided |
| **Financial reporting framework** | GAAP, OCBOA, or other specified framework |
| **Legend requirement** | Each page will include "no assurance" legend |

### 2. Understanding with Client

Before beginning, establish understanding of:
- Information to be provided by management
- Timing of information delivery
- Financial reporting framework to be used
- Delivery format (printed, electronic, etc.)
- Legend placement and wording

### 3. Performance Requirements

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant should possess an understanding of the applicable financial reporting framework and the significant accounting policies intended to be used in the preparation of the financial statements in order to prepare financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework." (AR-C 70.07)

**Plain English:**
You need to know:
- The accounting framework (GAAP, tax basis, cash basis, etc.)
- How to properly format financial statements
- Significant accounting policies for the client

### 4. The Legend Requirement

**This is Critical:**

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant should include a legend on each page of the financial statements indicating that 'no assurance is provided' on the financial statements." (AR-C 70.10)

**Example Legend Wording:**
```
"No assurance is provided on these financial statements."
```

Or:

```
"These financial statements have not been subjected to an audit, 
review, or compilation engagement, and no assurance is provided on them."
```

**Placement:**
- On EACH page of the financial statements
- May be in header, footer, or watermark
- Must be clear and conspicuous

## 📊 Disclosures in Preparation Engagements

### With Full Disclosures

You may prepare financial statements with full GAAP (or other framework) disclosures. In this case:
- All required disclosures are included
- Statements conform to framework requirements
- Legend still required on each page

### Without Disclosures (Substantially All Omitted)

**Official Language:**
> "When the accountant prepares financial statements that omit substantially all disclosures, the accountant is not required to disclose the omission of substantially all disclosures." (AR-C 70.A12)

**Plain English:**
You can prepare statements without any notes:
- Common for internal use
- No disclosure about the omission required
- Legend still required on each page
- Statement of cash flows may also be omitted

### Departure from Framework

If the financial statements contain known departures from the framework:
- Document your understanding of the departure
- Consider the effect on the financial statements
- The legend still applies

---

## 📄 No Accountant's Report Required

### Key Distinction from Compilation

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant is not required to issue a report on the financial statements when engaged to prepare financial statements." (AR-C 70.A2)

**Plain English:**

| Preparation | Compilation |
|-------------|-------------|
| No report required | Report is required |
| Legend on each page | Report accompanies statements |
| No assurance language | No assurance language |
| Lower service level | Higher service level |

---

## 📋 Documentation Requirements

### What to Document

**Official Language:**
> "The accountant should prepare documentation in connection with each preparation engagement that provides a sufficient record to document the engagement." (AR-C 70.11)

**Required Documentation:**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Engagement letter** | Signed agreement with client |
| **Financial statements prepared** | Copy with legend on each page |
| **Framework used** | Basis of accounting applied |
| **Significant matters** | Any issues encountered |
| **Understanding obtained** | Knowledge of client's business |

### Minimum Documentation

1. Engagement letter
2. Copy of financial statements with legend

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I issue a report on a preparation engagement?

No, AR-C 70 does not provide for the issuance of a report. If a report is needed, consider a compilation engagement under AR-C 80.

### Does the client sign the financial statements?

This is not required by SSARS, but some practitioners have management sign the statements to document management's acknowledgment of responsibility.

### Can I prepare financial statements for an entity I own?

Yes, independence is not required for preparation engagements. However, consider whether this is the best service for your situation.

### What if the client gives the financial statements to a third party?

The legend still applies. However, if the third party requires assurance, the client may need compilation or review services.

### Can I assist with bookkeeping and then prepare financial statements?

Yes, you can provide bookkeeping services and then prepare financial statements under AR-C 70.
