# AR-C Section 90: Review of Financial Statements

## Overview

AR-C Section 90 provides guidance for review engagements. A review engagement provides **limited assurance** on financial statements, which is more than a compilation but less than an audit. The accountant performs analytical procedures and makes inquiries to obtain a reasonable basis for expressing limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be made to the financial statements.

**This is the highest level of service available under SSARS.**

## 📜 Official AICPA Language

### Objective

> "The objective of the accountant when performing a review of financial statements is to obtain limited assurance as a basis for reporting whether the accountant is aware of any material modifications that should be made to the financial statements for them to be in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework, primarily through the performance of inquiry and analytical procedures." (AR-C 90.03)

### Scope

> "This section applies when an accountant is engaged to perform a review of financial statements." (AR-C 90.01)

### Definition

> "Review engagement—An engagement to perform review procedures on the financial statements and report on them. The report expresses limited assurance, which is less than reasonable assurance." (AR-C 90.07)

> "Limited assurance—A level of assurance that is less than the reasonable assurance obtained in an audit engagement but is at an acceptable level as the basis for the conclusion expressed in the accountant's review report." (AR-C 90.07)

## 📝 Plain English Interpretation

**What AR-C 90 Means for You:**

A review is significantly more than a compilation:
- You ARE providing assurance (limited, not reasonable)
- You MUST be independent
- You MUST perform analytical procedures
- You MUST make inquiries of management
- You MUST obtain a management representation letter
- Your report expresses a conclusion (not just a statement of no assurance)

**When to Use a Review:**
- Bank or creditor requires more than compilation
- Third parties need some level of assurance
- Client wants to demonstrate financial credibility
- Less costly than an audit
- Independence is achievable

## 🎯 Independence Requirements

### Official Language

> "The accountant should be independent when performing a review engagement." (AR-C 90.18)

> "If the accountant is not independent, the accountant should not report on the financial statements in accordance with this section." (AR-C 90.19)

### Plain English

**Independence is MANDATORY for review engagements.**

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Independence maintained | Proceed with review |
| Independence impaired | Cannot issue review report |
| Independence impaired | May step down to compilation (AR-C 80) |
| Independence impaired | Must consider if compilation appropriate |

### Independence Threats

Common threats to independence in SSARS engagements:

| Threat | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Self-interest** | Financial interest in client, loans, fee dependence |
| **Self-review** | Preparing records you then review |
| **Advocacy** | Promoting client's position |
| **Familiarity** | Close relationships with client personnel |
| **Undue influence** | Threats or pressure from client |

### Safeguards

If threats exist, apply safeguards:
- Separate personnel for bookkeeping vs. review
- Independent partner review
- External consultation
- Documentation of threat evaluation

**Bottom Line:** If you cannot maintain independence, you CANNOT perform a review.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the difference between limited and reasonable assurance?

**Limited assurance (review):** Based primarily on inquiries and analytical procedures. Expressed negatively ("I am not aware of any material modifications").

**Reasonable assurance (audit):** Based on extensive testing and evidence gathering. Expressed positively ("In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly").

### Can I step down from a review to a compilation?

Yes, if circumstances warrant (such as independence impairment). However, you must:
- Obtain new engagement letter
- Follow compilation requirements
- Issue compilation report
- Document the change

### What if I discover fraud during a review?

1. Communicate to appropriate level of management
2. If management is involved, communicate to those charged with governance
3. Consider whether to continue the engagement
4. Consider legal and regulatory reporting requirements
5. Document thoroughly
6. Consider impact on conclusion

### How is the review report different from a compilation report?

- Review report expresses a conclusion (limited assurance)
- Compilation report states no assurance is provided
- Review report includes independence statement
- Review report addresses management's and accountant's responsibilities more extensively

### Can substantially all disclosures be omitted in a review?

1. Attempt to obtain the information
2. Evaluate the effect on your conclusion
3. If material, modify your report
4. If pervasive, consider withdrawal

### Must I obtain a new representation letter each year?

Yes, you must obtain a signed representation letter for each review engagement. It should be dated the same date as your review report.
