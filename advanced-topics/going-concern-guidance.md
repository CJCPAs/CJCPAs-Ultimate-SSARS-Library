# Going Concern Evaluation in SSARS Engagements

## Overview

Going concern is one of the most critical assessments in financial reporting. This guide provides comprehensive guidance on evaluating going concern in compilation and review engagements.

---

## GAAP Requirements (ASC 205-40)

### Management's Responsibilities

Under GAAP, management is responsible for:

1. **Evaluating** whether conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about going concern
2. **Looking forward** one year from financial statement issuance date
3. **Considering** management's plans to mitigate adverse conditions
4. **Disclosing** when substantial doubt exists

### The Evaluation Framework

│  Step 1: IDENTIFY CONDITIONS AND EVENTS                     │
│  • Negative financial trends                                 │

│  Step 2: EVALUATE SUBSTANTIALITY OF DOUBT                   │
│  • Is it PROBABLE the entity cannot meet obligations?        │
│  • Consider likelihood, timing, magnitude                    │
│                                                              │
│  Step 3: CONSIDER MANAGEMENT'S PLANS                        │
│  • What plans exist to mitigate conditions?                 │
│  • Are the plans feasible?                                   │
│  • Is management able to implement them?                     │
│                                                              │
│  Step 4: DETERMINE IF PLANS ALLEVIATE DOUBT                 │
│  • Do plans make it NOT PROBABLE entity will fail?          │
│  • Is there substantial doubt AFTER considering plans?       │
│                                                              │
│  Step 5: DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS                            │
│  • If doubt alleviated → Disclose conditions & plans        │
│  • If doubt NOT alleviated → Disclose conditions & plans    │
│    with statement that substantial doubt exists              │
│                                                              │

## Accountant's Responsibilities

### In Compilation Engagements (AR-C 80)

**Limited responsibility, but not zero:**

| What You Must Do | What You Don't Do |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Read for obvious errors | Perform detailed evaluation |
| Address known departures | Independently assess conditions |
| Consider known information | Design procedures to find issues |

**Key Point:** If you KNOW about going concern conditions, you must ensure proper disclosure or modify your report.

### In Review Engagements (AR-C 90)

**More extensive responsibility:**

| Requirement | AR-C Reference |
|-------------|---------------|
| Inquire about going concern | AR-C 90.26(j) |
| Consider conditions and events | Through understanding and analytics |
| Evaluate management's assessment | Part of inquiry and evaluation |
| Ensure proper disclosure | Part of review procedures |

---

## Practical Application

### Compilation: When You Know About Conditions

**Scenario:** During compilation, you learn the client has:
- Net loss of $200,000
- Negative working capital
- Line of credit exhausted

**What to do:**

1. **Discuss with management:**
   - Have they evaluated going concern?
   - What are their plans?
   - Do they intend to disclose?

2. **If management properly discloses:**
   - Include disclosure in notes
   - Issue standard compilation report
   - May add emphasis paragraph (optional)

3. **If management refuses to disclose:**
   - This is a known departure from GAAP
   - Modify compilation report
   - Describe the conditions

### Review: Required Procedures

**Inquiry Areas:**

```
GOING CONCERN INQUIRIES:

[ ] Has management evaluated going concern?
[ ] What conditions exist that may raise doubt?
[ ] What are management's plans to address conditions?
[ ] Are the plans feasible and implementable?
[ ] What is the time frame for plan implementation?
[ ] What is the likelihood of success?
[ ] Has adequate disclosure been prepared?
```

**Analytical Procedures:**

```
GOING CONCERN ANALYTICS:

[ ] Working capital trend analysis
[ ] Cash flow analysis - operating, investing, financing
[ ] Debt-to-equity trends
[ ] Interest coverage ratio
[ ] Revenue trends and sustainability
[ ] Expense coverage analysis
[ ] Key customer/supplier dependency
```

## Management's Plans - What to Consider

### Types of Plans

| Plan Type | Examples | Considerations |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Obtain financing** | New loans, equity investment | Likelihood, terms, timing |
| **Sell assets** | Real estate, equipment, divisions | Fair value, marketability |
| **Reduce costs** | Layoffs, restructuring | Feasibility, impact |
| **Increase revenue** | New products, markets, customers | Probability of success |
| **Modify debt** | Extend terms, reduce payments | Lender willingness |

### Evaluating Feasibility

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|------------------|
| **Historical success** | Has management executed similar plans before? |
| **Current status** | What progress has been made? |
| **Commitment** | Is there documented commitment (letters of intent)? |
| **Timeline** | Can plans be implemented in time? |
| **Dependencies** | What must happen for plans to succeed? |

## Disclosure Requirements

### When Substantial Doubt Exists (Even if Alleviated by Plans)

Required disclosures:
- Principal conditions/events that raised substantial doubt
- Management's evaluation of significance
- Management's plans to mitigate conditions
- Statement that conditions are reasonably possible to raise substantial doubt

### When Substantial Doubt is NOT Alleviated

Additional required disclosures:
- Statement that substantial doubt about going concern exists
- All of the above disclosures

### Example Disclosure - Doubt Alleviated

```
NOTE X: GOING CONCERN

The Company has experienced recurring losses and has a working capital
deficiency as of December 31, 20XX. These conditions raised substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Management has taken the following steps to address these conditions:
• Negotiated a new $500,000 line of credit with ABC Bank, executed
  January 15, 20X1
• Implemented cost reduction measures expected to reduce operating
  expenses by 15% annually
• Entered into a new sales agreement with [Major Customer] expected
  to generate $1,000,000 in annual revenue

Management believes these actions will provide sufficient liquidity
to meet obligations as they become due over the next twelve months.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
```

### Example Disclosure - Doubt NOT Alleviated

```
NOTE X: GOING CONCERN

The Company has experienced recurring losses, has a working capital
deficiency, and is in default of its loan covenants as of December 31,
20XX. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
the financial statements are issued.

Management is pursuing the following plans to address these conditions:
• Seeking new equity investment of $2,000,000
• Negotiating with lenders for covenant waivers
• Exploring sale of non-core assets

There is no assurance that management's plans will be successful.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
```

## Common Errors and Deficiencies

| Error | Consequence | Prevention |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Not inquiring about going concern | Missed conditions | Always include in inquiry list |
| Accepting inadequate disclosure | GAAP departure not addressed | Compare disclosure to requirements |
| Not evaluating plans | Incomplete analysis | Document evaluation of each plan |
| Ignoring contrary evidence | Lack of skepticism | Consider all evidence objectively |
| Missing one-year period | Wrong evaluation period | Use issuance date + one year |

---

## Documentation Requirements

### Minimum Documentation

```
GOING CONCERN DOCUMENTATION:

[ ] Conditions identified (or note that none identified)
[ ] Source of information about conditions
[ ] Management's evaluation and plans
[ ] Your evaluation of management's plans (review)
[ ] Conclusion regarding going concern
[ ] Adequacy of disclosure
[ ] Report implications considered
```

### Example Documentation

```
GOING CONCERN EVALUATION

Client: XYZ Company
Period: Year Ended December 31, 20XX

CONDITIONS IDENTIFIED:
• Net loss of $150,000 (third consecutive year)
• Working capital deficiency of $75,000
• Line of credit exhausted

MANAGEMENT'S PLANS:
1. New investor expected to contribute $200,000 by March 20X1
   - Letter of intent dated January 10, 20X1 reviewed
   - Investor has financial capacity per management
2. Cost reductions of approximately $100,000 annually
   - Reduction in force completed January 5, 20X1

MY EVALUATION [Review only]:
Plan 1: Letter of intent provides reasonable basis for expectation.
        Reviewed investor's bank reference.
Plan 2: Layoffs have been implemented. Savings are quantifiable.

CONCLUSION:
Management has identified conditions that raised substantial doubt.
Management's plans appear feasible and, if implemented as expected,
should alleviate the substantial doubt.

DISCLOSURE:
Disclosure in Note X is adequate and addresses all required elements.

REPORT:
Standard [review/compilation] report appropriate. Considered adding
emphasis paragraph - determined not to add as disclosure is adequate.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Management evaluates, not the accountant** - But accountant ensures GAAP compliance
2. **Look forward one year from issuance** - Not from balance sheet date
3. **Consider plans but be skeptical** - Evaluate feasibility, not just existence
4. **Disclosure is required either way** - Whether doubt is alleviated or not
5. **Document your work** - Show what you considered and concluded
6. **Compilation has limits** - But address what you know
7. **Review requires inquiry** - This is a required inquiry area
