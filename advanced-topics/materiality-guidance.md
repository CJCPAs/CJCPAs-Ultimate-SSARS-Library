# Materiality in SSARS Engagements

## Overview

Materiality is a fundamental concept in financial reporting and affects how accountants approach compilation and review engagements. This guide provides practical guidance on materiality determination and application.

## GAAP Definition

> "The omission or misstatement of an item in a financial report is material if, in light of surrounding circumstances, the magnitude of the item is such that it is probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying upon the report would have been changed or influenced by the inclusion or correction of the item." - FASB Concepts Statement No. 8

## Materiality in SSARS Context

### Compilation Engagements

| Role of Materiality | Application |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Reading for obvious errors | Material obvious errors must be addressed |
| Known departures | Material departures require report modification |
| Disclosure omission | "Substantially all" = generally material disclosures |

### Review Engagements (SSARS 25 Changes)

SSARS 25 introduced explicit materiality requirements:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Determine materiality | For financial statements as a whole |
| Apply to procedures | Design analytics and inquiries accordingly |
| Evaluate misstatements | Consider identified misstatements |
| Document | Document materiality determined |

### Step 2: Apply Appropriate Percentage

| Benchmark | Typical Range | Common Starting Point |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Pre-tax income | 3% - 10% | 5% |
| Revenue | 0.5% - 2% | 1% |
| Total assets | 0.5% - 2% | 1% |
| Equity | 1% - 5% | 2% |
| Gross profit | 1% - 5% | 2% |
| Total expenses (NFP) | 0.5% - 2% | 1% |

### Step 3: Consider Qualitative Factors

| Factor | Effect on Materiality |
|--------|----------------------|
| User reliance | Higher reliance → Lower threshold |
| Industry volatility | More volatile → Higher threshold |
| Debt covenants | Near threshold → Lower threshold |
| Management integrity | Concerns → Lower threshold |
| Regulatory environment | High regulation → Lower threshold |
| Size of entity | Smaller → May need higher % |

## Materiality Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Profitable Manufacturing Company

**Financial Data:**
- Revenue: $10,000,000
- Pre-tax income: $500,000
- Total assets: $4,000,000
- Equity: $2,000,000

**Calculation:**

| Benchmark | Amount | % | Materiality |
|-----------|--------|---|-------------|
| Pre-tax income | $500,000 | 5% | $25,000 |
| Revenue | $10,000,000 | 1% | $100,000 |
| Total assets | $4,000,000 | 1% | $40,000 |

**Selection:**
- Pre-tax income is stable and meaningful
- $25,000 is selected as materiality
- Represents 0.25% of revenue, 0.6% of assets - reasonable

### Example 2: Breakeven/Loss Company

**Financial Data:**
- Revenue: $5,000,000
- Pre-tax income: $0 (breakeven)
- Total assets: $2,000,000
- Average pre-tax income (3 years): $150,000

**Calculation:**

| Benchmark | Amount | % | Materiality |
|-----------|--------|---|-------------|
| Revenue | $5,000,000 | 1% | $50,000 |
| Total assets | $2,000,000 | 1% | $20,000 |
| Normalized income | $150,000 | 5% | $7,500 |

**Selection:**
- Cannot use current year income (zero)
- Consider normalized income, revenue, or assets
- $25,000 selected (between revenue and asset calculations)

### Example 3: Nonprofit Organization

**Financial Data:**
- Total revenues: $3,000,000
- Total expenses: $2,800,000
- Total assets: $1,500,000
- Net assets: $500,000

**Calculation:**

| Benchmark | Amount | % | Materiality |
|-----------|--------|---|-------------|
| Total revenues | $3,000,000 | 1% | $30,000 |
| Total expenses | $2,800,000 | 1% | $28,000 |
| Total assets | $1,500,000 | 1% | $15,000 |

**Selection:**
- Total expenses is primary benchmark for NFPs
- $28,000 selected
- Represents approximately 1% of expenses

## Performance Materiality

### Concept

Performance materiality is set lower than overall materiality to reduce the risk that undetected misstatements exceed overall materiality.

### In Reviews

While not as formally defined as in audits, consider:
- Setting a threshold for investigating analytical differences
- Typically 50-75% of overall materiality
- Document the basis

### Example:

| Level | Amount | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Overall materiality | $25,000 | Financial statements as a whole |
| Performance materiality | $15,000 | Threshold for investigation |
| Posting threshold | $5,000 | Items below this typically ignored |

---

## Qualitative Materiality

### Always Material Items

Certain items are material regardless of amount:

| Item | Why Material |
|------|-------------|
| Related party transactions | Nature, not just amount |
| Fraud | Intentional misstatement |
| Illegal acts | Regulatory implications |
| Loan covenant violations | Even technical breaches |
| Changes in accounting | Comparability affected |
| Management compensation | Governance implications |

### Qualitative Factors

| Factor | Materiality Impact |
|--------|-------------------|
| Masks a trend | Could be material |
| Changes loss to profit | Highly material |
| Affects bonus calculation | Could be material |
| Misses analyst expectations | Consider context |
| Violates covenant by $1 | Material due to consequences |

---

## Applying Materiality

### In Compilation Engagements

| Step | Application |
|------|-------------|
| Reading statements | Would an item affect reader's judgment? |
| Obvious errors | Is the error material? |
| Known departures | Is the departure material to disclose? |
| Report modification | Describe material departures |

### In Review Engagements

| Step | Application |
|------|-------------|
| Planning | Determine materiality for the engagement |
| Analytics | Investigate differences exceeding threshold |
| Inquiries | Focus on material areas |
| Evaluation | Aggregate misstatements and compare to materiality |
| Conclusion | Are uncorrected misstatements material? |

---

## Evaluating Misstatements

### Accumulate Misstatements

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Known | Specifically identified misstatements |
| Likely | Projected from specific identification |
| Estimated | Estimates where actual may differ |

### Compare to Materiality

```
MISSTATEMENT EVALUATION:

Known misstatements:
  - Uncorrected depreciation error          $ 3,000
  - Classification error (immaterial)             0

Likely misstatements:
  - Projected A/R understatement           $ 8,000

Total uncorrected misstatements:           $11,000

Materiality:                               $25,000

Conclusion: Uncorrected misstatements ($11,000) are
           less than materiality ($25,000). No
           modification to conclusion required.
```

## Common Errors

| Error | Consequence | Prevention |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Not determining materiality | Inconsistent application | Always calculate |
| Using arbitrary number | May be too high or low | Use benchmark approach |
| Ignoring qualitative factors | Missing material items | Consider nature, not just size |
| Not documenting | Peer review deficiency | Document all decisions |
| Not reconsidering | Changed circumstances missed | Revise if facts change |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Materiality is required for reviews (SSARS 25)** - Must determine and document
2. **Compilation uses materiality concept** - For obvious errors and departures
3. **Use appropriate benchmarks** - Select based on entity type and circumstances
4. **Consider qualitative factors** - Amount alone isn't enough
5. **Document your determination** - Show the basis for your conclusion
6. **Accumulate and evaluate** - Compare total misstatements to materiality
7. **Reconsider if circumstances change** - Materiality isn't static
