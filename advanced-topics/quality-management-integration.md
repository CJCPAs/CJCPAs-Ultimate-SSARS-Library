## The Quality Management Framework

### From Quality Control to Quality Management

| Old Approach (QC) | New Approach (QM) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Policies and procedures | Risk-based system |
| Reactive compliance | Proactive management |
| One-size-fits-all | Scalable and tailored |
| Annual inspection | Continuous monitoring |
| Check-the-box | Achieve objectives |

## SQMS No. 2: Engagement Quality Reviews

### When EQR May Be Appropriate for SSARS

The firm establishes policies for when EQR is required. Consider:

| Factor | Higher Risk (Consider EQR) | Lower Risk |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| Entity type | Public interest, significant | Private, smaller |
| Complexity | Complex transactions | Straightforward |
| Engagement team | New partner, inexperienced | Experienced team |
| Prior issues | History of problems | Clean history |
| Industry | Specialized, unfamiliar | Common industries |

### EQR for Review Engagements

Review engagements provide limited assurance, making EQR more likely to be appropriate than for compilations.

**EQR Focus Areas for Reviews:**
- [ ] Independence properly evaluated
- [ ] Analytical procedures adequate
- [ ] Inquiries comprehensive
- [ ] Going concern considered
- [ ] Subsequent events evaluated
- [ ] Report appropriate

### EQR Qualifications

The engagement quality reviewer must:
- Not be part of engagement team
- Have sufficient competence and capabilities
- Have time to perform thorough review
- Be objective (no close personal relationships)

**Small Firm Options:**
- Second partner in firm
- External CPA (reciprocal arrangement)
- Peer reviewer
- Contracted reviewer

## Common Questions

### Q: Is this really required for small firms?
**A:** Yes. Every firm performing SSARS engagements must have a QM system. However, the system should be scaled to firm size and complexity.

### Q: What if I'm a sole practitioner?
**A:** Your QM system will be simpler. You may be able to address many requirements through your personal practices and judgment. Document how you maintain quality.

### Q: How much documentation is required?
**A:** Document enough to demonstrate your system is designed and operating. Focus on risk assessment, policies, and monitoring evidence.

### Q: What happens if I'm not compliant by December 15, 2025?
**A:** Non-compliance could result in peer review findings, potential ethics violations, and professional liability exposure.

### Q: Can I use my old quality control document?
**A:** You'll need to update it to address the new risk-based approach and eight components. A simple revision of existing QC policies is unlikely to be sufficient.
